'''DJ Roxxi''' (born Deshnie Govender on 5 April 1985) is a South African DJ, who gained recognition from 2006 onwards as the only Indian female [[Disc jockey|club DJ]] in [[South Africa]].

==Early life and education==
Roxxi was born in Isipingo, [[Durban|Durban, South Africa]]. She is the daughter of Ruth Govender and Vassie Mottai Govender, who died in 2002. She has a younger sister Michelle Govender. Roxxi attended Holy Family College for a short while and thereafter Isipingo [[Primary education|Primary School]]. She completed high school at Kingsway High School in Amanzimtoti. In 2002 Roxxi lost her father to a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the final examination of high school; despite this trauma, she graduated from high school with excellent results. Although Roxxi anticipated embarking on a music career straight after high school, she made the difficult choice to study first as it was frowned upon in the Indian community for a young girl to become a club DJ. Roxxi enrolled in [[Natal University]] to study towards a LLB (law) Degree. Towards the end of 2003, Roxxi dropped out of her course. During this break she discovered her musical talents while working [[part time]] at her mother's [[nightclub]] in [[Amanzimtoti]].

==Music career==
===2005-2006===
Roxxi was exposed to the music styles of various DJs at her mother's club. She taught herself how to play by researching and watching other DJs perform. From 2005 to 2006 Roxxi played at many low-key promotions at her mother's club gaining confidence and skills through each event. Very soon word got out that there was an Indian female DJ around and journalists were interested in hearing her story. The media buzz that surrounded Roxxi propelled her onto the music scene overnight. Heralded as the first and only Indian female club DJ in South Africa, Roxxi was soon asked to appear at many events and shows.

===2007-2009===
In 2007, Roxxi was selected as the only female DJ on board the AXE Jet Experience to [[Ibiza]] with top SA celebrities. This gave Roxxi the opportunity to travel to [[Ibiza]] and perform with top South African [[5FM]] DJ's.

===Debut single===
In 2009, DJ Roxxi decided to embark on a new venture. She teamed up with long time friend and fellow artist Nic Billington and penned a track entitled "Away". The track features Nic Billington on vocals and was produced by Craig Massiv from Flash Republic fame. 

The track which was offered as free download to fans reached number one on the top 9 at 9 on East Coast Radio on 4 December 2009 making Roxxi the first female DJ in South Africa to have a number 1 single.

==Writing career==
Currently a 3rd year journalism student, Roxxi has submitted articles for www.jhbdesi.co.za, www.simplybhangra.com and South African lifestyle magazine EISH.

==Awards==
It was this [[Optimism|positive attitude]] that saw Roxxi being nominated as one of [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan Magazine]]'s Top 25 Awesome Women of 2006. The event held at the [[Hyatt|Park Hyatt]] in Johannesburg profiled and introduced all 28 finalists, including [[Shannon Esra]], [[Noni Gasa]] and [[Louise Carver]].
