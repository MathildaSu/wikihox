'''Quantum anthropology''' is the discipline that studies [[culture]] and humanity from an [[quantum]] perspective. Quantum anthropology is an emerging field and represent a link between [[cultural anthropology]], [[social anthropology]] and quantum mechanics.

==History==

The basic principles of quantum anthropology were formulated by Heidi Ann Russell<ref>Russell, Heidi Ann (2013). Quantum anthropology: Reimaging the human person as body/spirit. Theological Studies 74: 934-959.

==Overview==

The fundamentals of quantum anthropology are [[wave-particle duality]] and [[wave function collapse]]. Quantum anthropology understands humans and cultures as actualizations of potentiality in time and space. Matter is both [[particle]]/[[wave]], energy is a field, and everything simultaneously has the characteristics of a [[particle]] as well as a [[wave]]. Every person is an embodiment of a part of the energy-information field and is determined by their anatomy, physiology, and psyche, that can change to a certain extent in time.
Humans and cultures are all a part of interconnected interpersonal relationships, others' interests, and public interests. Every human action has the potential to develop, to qualitatively change, or to limit the potential choices of someone else or of an entire group of people. The [[free will]] is never absolute and always limited. The mutual interconnectedness of individual, group and public interests is analogical to the phenomenon known as [[quantum entanglement]].
[[Cultural systems]], [[social systems]] and humans exist in time and space - they arise, evolve, and collapse. The [[crises]] are indicators of destabilization and the frequency of individual crises increases as the final [[collapse|Societal collapse]] is approaching. The trajectory of crises in the period before a collapse has the shape of a conical [[helix]] similar to a [[vortex]]. The heretofore embodied part of the energy-information field returns back into to the global, wave-particle energy-information potential after the final collapse of the system.<ref>Trnka Radek (2015).
