“Cousin Vinny” Agnello

[[:it:File:COUSIN_VINNY_1.jpg|[File:COUSIN_VINNY_1.jpg]]]

Louis Anthony “Cousin Vinny” Agnello (born January 30, 1960) is an American morality writer.

He is best known for his nationally critically acclaimed novel, “The Devil’s Glove”.

The San Jose Mercury Newspaper recently described his life as an “eye-popping head swivel.”

Born in Flushing, New York, Agnello’s done bit parts on soap operas and feature films, studied acting with Lee Strasberg, and worked for 13 years as a high-end stripper for the upper crust.

He used the monikers “Stripper King of New York and The King of Bling.” Once he retired from stripping he managed strippers for a time.

Along the way, he earned a bachelor's degree in English, got involved in a legal battle with Doctor’s Associates Incorporated, the people who run “Subway Restaurants,” in a dispute where he claimed fraud, was shot twice in a botched robbery attempt that allegedly occurred because the thieves wanted his “bling”, and he along with his famous book was featured in “Faith” columns all over America in 2014.

Recently he has signed a literary representation deal with the famous science fiction writer, Ben Bova’s literary agency.

Since 1986 he has been news.  

As a stripper, his fame was so out there, he was a guest on Regis and Kathie Lee Live. Later he would be a featured guest on the O’Reilly Factor, Hannity and Colmes, and Judith Regan Tonight among many others.

“Cousin Vinny” recently completed the sequel to “The Devil’s Glove” called “The Revenge of the Manager”.

In 2014 the national magazine “Adweek” opened their feature on “Cousin Vinny” by saying, “If you’ve forgotten or never read about Agnello’s incredible life story, do yourself a favor and take the time to digest the details of Savannah Morning News entertainment writer Linda Sickler’s profile piece.  

The article encompasses 9/11, Subway Sandwich shops, acting aspirations, a 2001 media firestorm in Chappaqua, NY.

And a “hoo ha” of a career regret… Sickler isn’t kidding when she leads with the idea that this Cousin’s experiences would make a great movie.”

"In February of 2014, Agnello kicked off a long U.S. book signing tour. He's been in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and the list just keeps traveling. He made California stops in Bakersfield, Palmdale, Visalia, Fresno, Turlock, Tracy, Stockton and San Jose. Agnello notes the book is "bigger than him" and he is more of a "messenger" than an author.

While his book is fictional, and he says, "not preachy," he also said he has lived part of the book's message as he headed many times full speed ahead down a path that eventually left him empty. He hopes his book will captivate readers, will inspire, and maybe even help save someone who is troubled and considering "bringing their life to a premature end." Judging by the long, long line of people of all ages that look out from the author's Facebook page, each looking genuinely pleased as they hold a "Devil's Glove" copy and pose with Agnello, this messenger might really be onto something.

"The Devil's Glove" is the fictional tale of minor league baseball player Billy Green, who has lost his way after years of disappointment and summons a "mysterious stranger who promises to help him cheat his way on to the big stage of major league baseball if he lives up to the terms of a nefarious agreement." On the surface, the 371-page soft cover novel sounds a bit like "Damn Yankees" and/or a retelling of the classic German tale of "Faust." And it definitely is a precautionary tale about the temptations of evil. But the reviews are coming in, strong and sturdy for a good read. It has been called a "spiritual thriller," a "timeless tale that will renew your faith in God and human nature." Barnes & Noble writes that "The Devil's Glove" is "mostly baseball, partly supernatural and inspirational"
