'''Rajee Narinesingh''' is an American [[transgender]] [[activist]], [[actress]], [[author]], and [[singer]] most known for her appearances on talk shows such as: [[Dr. Phil]], Trisha Goddard (TV series), and [[Anderson Cooper 360Â°]]; discussing her mistrust in an unlicensed transgender doctor who injected: cement, tire sealant, and glue into her: face, breasts, hips, and buttocks; passing it off as medical-grade silicone. The procedures caused terrible side-effects for Rajee; landing her in the hospital and having to receive multiple surgeries to remove the harmful chemicals that were put into her face and body. To promote her story in the hopes of helping transgender youth who can't afford cosmetic surgeries, Narinesingh has released a memoir, ''Beyond Face Value: The Journey to True Beauty''. She has also appeared as Aunt Norma in the un-aired independent television show, ''Bella Maddo'', the first all transgender cast to play "non-transgender" roles.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/13/rajee-narinesingh_n_4783079.html</ref><ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/botched-surgery-victim-rajee-narinesingh-3136750</ref><ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2067670/Shocking-new-pictures-reveal-horrific-damage-face-woman-injected-cement-tyre-sealant-butt-implant-doctor.html</ref><ref>http://www.medicaldaily.com/plastic-surgery-nightmare-earns-florida-woman-nickname-cement-face-fake-doctor-oneal-ron-morris-used</ref>
