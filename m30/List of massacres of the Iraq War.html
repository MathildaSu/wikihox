During the [[Iraq War]] of the 2000s (decade), both the Insurgency and the Coalition forces committed various [[massacre]]s and abuses.

This list currently covers only notable events or events in which civilians or prisoners were killed in mass; far more numerous massacres perpetrated by insurgents have occurred. It is not necessarily exhaustive, and sources frequently disagree on the number of deaths.
