'''Electronic Recycling Association''' is a Canadian non-profit corporation that collects unwanted computers and electronics from private individuals and businesses.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/donating-old-electronics-helps-needy-environment-say-recycling-groups-1.571792 | title=Donating old electronics helps needy, environment, say recycling groups | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4728453-business-in-brief-donate-at-staples-to-get-local-kids-ready-for-school/|title=Computers donated to Albion Neighbourhood Services|last=Peacock|first=Grace|date=July 31, 2014|work=Etobicoke Guardian|quote=Albion Neighbourhood Services in north Etobicoke is the recent recipient of computers donated by the Electronic Recycling Association (ERA)|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=More than just OK computers — e-recycler donates 24 rigs to Catholic Family Services |first=Renato |last=Gandia |work=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2014-02-21 |accessdate=2014-09-10 |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/2014/02/21/more-than-just-ok-computers--e-recycler-donates-24-rigs-to-catholic-family-services }}</ref> The computers are [[Refurbishment (electronics)|refurbished]], if possible, and the corporation claims that all of the data is [[Data erasure|securely erased]].<ref name="newswire"/>

==Overview==
The company was founded in 2004 in [[Calgary]] by Canadian businessman Bojan Paduh.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/profit+association+explosive+relationship+with+recyclers+with+video/8463386/story.html | title=Non-profit association has an explosive relationship with big B.C. recyclers | publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]] | date=3 June 2013 | accessdate=14 September 2014 | author=Pynn, Larry}}</ref> In 2013, the company moved into a new facility in the [[Greater Vancouver]] area.<ref name="wsj1">{{cite web | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130602-900879.html | title=The Electronic Recycling Association introduces the only mobile hard drive shredders in Western Canada, and Metro Vancouver | publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=2 June 2013 | accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

According to Calgary's [[Catholic Family Service]], ERA aims to avoid unnecessary waste or deteriorative environmental effects by repurposing electronic equipment to make it reach its actual end of life.<ref name="The Digital Principal">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=RK5xAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Digital Principal|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="cfs-ab.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.cfs-ab.org/electronic-recycling-association-era-donates-24-complete-computer-systems-for-use-in-our-main-offi|title=Catholic Family Service - Electronic Recycling Association (ERA) donates 24 complete computer systems for use in our main office and at the Louise Dean Centre.|publisher=}}</ref>

ERA uses [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]]-certified software in order to erase data from hard drives and remove any sensitive information before equipment is distributed as charity. When dealing with clients with financial data that might be considered sensitive, such as banks, the hard disks are physically scrapped using large [[drill press]]es.<ref name="Gignac">{{cite web |date=15 January 2009 | first=T | last= Gignac|work=  Calgary Herald | title= Discarded computers ripe for identity theft | url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/city/story.html?id=f011946b-f119-4a2f-b763-ad28301f7330

On the other hand, Bojan Paduh claims to have made repetitive attempts to partner with Encorp, including offers of sorting electronics waste for them, but to no avail.<ref name="Trashing the city's technology">{{cite web|url=http://thethunderbird.ca/2008/04/14/trashed-technology-sparks-recycling-program/|title=Trashing the city's technology|work=TheThunderbird.ca}}</ref>

=== Controversies ===
A 2013 investigation by the [[Vancouver Sun]] found that the company was reselling and exporting the refurbished computers.<ref name="VancouverSun">{{cite web|title=Non-profit association has an explosive relationship with big B.C. recyclers|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/profit+association+explosive+relationship+with+recyclers+with+video/8463386/story.html|work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |first=Larry |last=Pynn |date=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}</ref> A number of the computers sold contained sensitive information. Despite ERA's claims that secure data erasure is part of its role, an official investigation into one computer sold with data on it found that the original owner, [[Bow Valley College]] (BVC), was accountable for the sensitive information under the [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Alberta)|FOIP Act]], not ERA.<ref>{{cite CanLII|litigants=Report on an investigation into personal information discovered on a purchased computer server |year=2013|court=aboipc|num=52666|format=canlii|date=2013-07-04|courtname=Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner|juris=Alberta}}</ref>

The director of ERA in Calgary has also shown concern at disappeared computers after donors leave their unneeded equipment outside the association's depot late at night or on weekends.<ref>http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/city/story.html?id=f011946b-f119-4a2f-b763-ad28301f7330</ref>
