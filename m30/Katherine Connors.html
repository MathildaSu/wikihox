===Miguel Batista incident===
[[File:Katherine Connors ceremonial pitch 11.jpg|thumb|left|Connors after throwing the ceremonial pitch]]Connors gained national attention in July 2010 after a comment from [[Washington Nationals]] [[pitcher]] [[Miguel Batista]] led to her throwing a ceremonial pitch at a Nationals game.  In a previous game Batista was announced as the replacement started for [[Stephen Strasburg]] who was injured.<ref name="daily" />  The crowd booed Batista as he walked onto the field, which lead to him commenting after the game, "Imagine if you go to see Miss Universe, then you end up having to watch Miss Iowa. You might get those kind of boos".<ref>{{cite news|title=Katherine Connors: Can Miguel Batista walk in a swimsuit|publisher=Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/28/AR2010072805933.html|date=2010-07-29}}</ref>  When Connors replied in a statement, "I know I can throw a pitch or two! The question is, can Miguel Batista walk the runway in a swimsuit?" Batista sent her flowers and she was invited to throw a ceremonial pitch at Nationals Park on 30 July 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Photos: Who Is Katherine Connors, Miss Iowa?|publisher=MyFoxPhoenix|url=http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/entertainment/who-is-miss-iowa-katherine-connors-dpgoha-20100730-jst1280508191688|date=2010-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Some humiliation not always a bad thing|publisher=Associated Press|first=Tim|last=Dahlberg|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gLj3-5_z66jITnOmpmUszBdYDqwgD9HA80UO0|date=2010-07-30}}</ref>  Batista has been invited to judge the 2011 Miss Iowa USA competition.<ref name="daily">{{cite news|title=Miss Iowa Katherine Connors to visit Washington Nationals after pitcher Miguel Batista's insult|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2010/07/29/2010-07-29_miss_iowa_katharine_connors_to_visit_washington_nationals_after_pitcher_miguel_b.html|publisher=New York Daily News|date=2010-07-29 | first=Bobby | last=Melok}}</ref>
