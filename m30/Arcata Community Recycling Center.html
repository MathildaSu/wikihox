The '''Arcata Community Recycling Center''' ('''ACRC'''),  founded after [[Earth Day]] 1970, is one of America's oldest non-profit [[recycling]] centers. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The center promotes eco-conscience in the North Coast and facilitates diversion of materials from landfills in [[Arcata, California|Arcata]] and [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[California]].

The mission of ACRC is to promote and demonstrate innovative waste reduction, reuse and recycling strategies as socially and economically beneficial methods to conserve the Earthâ€™s finite resources. ACRC runs several facilities and programs to fulfill the mission statement. The operation of recycling drop-off sites in Arcata and Eureka provides a location for community members to recycle a wide variety of materials. The Arcata drop-off (and ACRC's original headquarters) was initially located at 10th and F St. Operations moved to the current location at 9th & N St. in the early 1980s. In 2002, ACRC began operation of the Eureka Community Recycling Center adjacent to the Humboldt Waste Management Authority's Transfer Station located in Eureka.

The Reusables Depot Thrift Store, also at the 9th & N St. location, serves as a reuse center for unwanted household and sporting goods, building materials, and garden supplies.

In 2007 ACRC opened the 35,800 sq. ft. Samoa Processing Facility which houses a dual stream sorting line. This facility is a green building and is slated for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification.<ref>http://www.northcoastjournal.com/issues/2007/01/25/constructing-solutions/ North Coast Journal accessed 2009-04-12</ref> Recyclables enter the facility in two streams, mixed papers and containers, from curbside collection and drop off sites and are sorted by material type using a combination of machine and people power. This facility diverts over 11,000 tons of materials from the landfill annually.

The Samoa site is also home to the Bette Dobkin Education Center where students of all ages learn about resource conservation.

[[Wes Chesbro]] led the center during its infancy.<ref>http://www.northcoastjournal.com/oct97/10-97.cvrstry.html North Coast Journal accessed 2009-04-11</ref>
