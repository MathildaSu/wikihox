In May 2014, a man named '''Isidro Merdrano Garcia'''<ref name=Nanny/> or '''Isidro Medrano Garcia'''<ref name=Cocca/><ref name=Conflict/> (aged 41<ref name=Found/><ref name=Neighbors/><ref name=Baffled/><ref name=Mother>Flaccus, G., and Abdollah, T., "[http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Police-claim-friendly-neighbor-was-kidnap-rapist-5497162.php Mother persuaded kidnapped woman to go to police]", [[Associated Press]], May 22, 2014.</ref><ref name=Fabricated/><ref name=Prosecutors/> or 42<ref name=Nanny/><ref name=Cocca/>), who had been living under the name '''Tomas Medrano'''<ref name=Conflict/><ref name=Found/><ref name=Mother/><ref name=Fabricated/> or '''Tomas Madrano''',<ref name=Neighbors/> was arrested and accused by police of kidnapping a 15-year-old girl in 2004 and repeatedly raping her and continuing to hold her captive until 2014.<ref name=Cocca>Cocca, C., "[http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/santa-ana-teen-kidnap-found-decade-later-facebook-260171971.html Man Arrested for Allegedly Kidnapping, Raping Teen Held Captive for 10 Years: Police]", [[NBC]] Los Angeles, May 22, 2014.</ref> Garcia allegedly forced the victim to marry him in 2007 and had a child with her on October 27, 2010<ref name=Key/> or in 2012,<ref name=Cocca/><ref name=Fabricated/> and they continued lived openly together as a family in [[Bell Gardens, California]] until the woman contacted her sister through [[Facebook]] and met with her mother in April 2014 and then filed a [[domestic violence]] complaint with Bell Gardens police on May 19, 2014.<ref name=Key/> Despite their apparently active social life in the community, including hosting large parties and the woman spending time and running errands by herself and working outside the home (with Garcia), police said the woman had tried to escape twice and been severely beaten.<ref name=Neighbors/>

Through his attorney, Garcia has claimed that the woman made up the story of abuse because the couple was breaking up.<ref name=Fabricated>Flaccus, G., and Abdollah, T., "[http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/05/22/alleged-california-kidnapper-wife-fabricated-horrific-crimes-because-we-were-breaking-up/ Alleged California kidnapper: Wife fabricated horrible crimes because we were breaking up]", [[Associated Press]], May 22, 2014.</ref>

Some neighbors and a nanny for their child reported that the man and woman were active as a couple in the local church and social community and showed no apparent signs of serious problems prior to the man's arrest.<ref name=Nanny>Kandel, J., and Medina, M., "[http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Nanny-Described-Kidnapper-Victim-as-Perfect-Couple-260214621.html Nanny Describes Alleged Kidnapper, Victim as 'Perfect Couple']", [[NBC]] Los Angeles, May 22, 2014.</ref><ref name=Neighbors>Abdollah, T., "[http://www.sunherald.com/2014/05/21/5591925/neighbors-alleged-kidnapper-is.html Neighbors: Alleged kidnapper is doting family man]", [[Associated Press]], May 21, 2014.</ref><ref name=Baffled>McLaughlin, E. C., "[http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/us/california-kidnap-victim-found/ Neighbors baffled that California woman missing for decade was kidnapped]", [[CNN]], May 22, 2014.</ref> A neighbor said "He treats her like a queen. He does his best to do whatever she wants", and said the woman had her own car.<ref name=Neighbors/><ref name=Fabricated/> However, some other neighbors said they sensed that not all was well.<ref name=Prosecutors/> One said that Garcia seemed to closely watch her, and that when she noticed he was watching from their apartment, she would rapidly go back inside.<ref name=Prosecutors/>

The girl was born in Mexico<ref name=Cocca/> and had [[illegal immigration|unlawfully]] entered the U.S. from Mexico in February 2004<ref name=Found>Flaccus, G., "[http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Police-Woman-found-10-years-after-kidnapping-5498074.php Police: Woman found 10 years after kidnapping]", [[Associated Press]], May 22, 2014.</ref> (about six months before her alleged kidnapping) to join her mother and sister who were living in [[Santa Ana, California]].<ref name=Key>"[http://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Key-moments-in-California-kidnapping-case-5499165.php Key moments in California kidnapping case]", [[Associated Press]], May 22, 2014.</ref> Garcia was the girl's mother's live-in boyfriend,<ref name=Cocca/> and allegedly began abusing her while she lived with her mother.<ref name=Cocca/><ref name=Key/> Following a domestic argument between the girl's mother and Garcia,<ref name=Found/><ref name=Mother/> the girl left home and went to a park, where Garcia found her and allegedly drugged and kidnapped her and then held her captive in a garage in [[Compton, California|Compton]]<ref name=Baffled/> while telling her that no one was looking for her and that she would be deported if she was found. She was unable to speak English at the time,<ref name=Fabricated/><ref name=Prosecutors/> and Garcia allegedly used this to intimidate her. The girl's mother filed a [[missing person]]'s report in August 2004, shortly after the alleged abduction,<ref name=Key/> and had suspected that Garcia had abducted her.<ref name=Nanny/><ref name=Cocca/>

After she contacted her mother a decade later in 2014, her mother reportedly showed her old news articles to prove that she had been looking for her and had filed a missing person's report.<ref name=Mother/><ref name=Prosecutors/> This reportedly helped convince her to go to the police and file a report about her alleged abduction.<ref name=Mother/>

It was alleged that during her captivity, the woman had been moved at least four times and had been given multiple fake identities.<ref name=Found/><ref name=Neighbors/><ref name=Mother/>

Garcia held various jobs during the period of the alleged captivity, and the woman and Garcia had been working together outside the home for a night cleaning service<ref name=Cocca/><ref name=Baffled/> â€“ including cleaning a building that houses offices of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.<ref name=Prosecutors>"[http://www.leaderherald.com/page/content.detail/id/509466/Prosecutors-say-devoted-husband-is-kidnap-rapist.html?isap=1&nav=5041 Prosecutors say devoted husband is kidnap-rapist]", [[Associated Press]], May 23, 2014.</ref><ref>Flaccus, G., and Abdollah, T., "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/22/victim-lies-isidro-garcia-kidnapping_n_5375381.html Victim is Lying about Alleged Kidnapping, Isidro Garcia's Lawyer Claims]", [[Associated Press]], May 22, 2014.</ref> At the time of the arrest, Garcia was also working a second job, at a nearby Chinese restaurant.<ref name=Conflict>Flores, A., and Esquivel, P., "[http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-girl-abducted-20140523-story.html Kidnapping Claims Conflict with Neighbors' View of Bell Gardens Couple]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 22, 2014.</ref>
