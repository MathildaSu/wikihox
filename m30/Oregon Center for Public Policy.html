The '''Oregon Center for Public Policy''' ('''OCPP''') is an American economic research organization that conducts research on budget, tax, and economics issues. The organization says its goal is "to improve decision making and generate more opportunities for all Oregonians."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ocpp.org/cgi-bin/display.cgi?page=about | work=Oregon Center for Public Policy | title=About OCPP | accessdate=August 20, 2010}}</ref> The group has lobbied the [[government of Oregon]] since about 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=Liberal Oregon activist says tax hikes are good|first=Jeff|last=Mapes

The Oregon Center for Public Policy has weighed in on how certain policies (such as welfare assistance programs, taxes,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1219200915204700.xml&coll=7 | title=November tax initiative seen slicing $1 billion or more from Oregon budget | work=Oregonian | date=August 20, 2008 | first=Dave | last=Hogan}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2009/10/economists_weigh_into_oregon_t.html

The organization's policy analysts have advocated increases to the state [[minimum wage]], as well as yearly wage increases that are based on the cost of living (which is measured by the [[Consumer Price Index]]).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bendweekly.com/Statewide-News/11760.html | work=Bend Weekly | title=Rise in Oregon's minimum wage set to take effect | date=December 28, 2007}}</ref> The OCPP typically weighs in each year on indexing increases to the state's minimum wage. When an early estimate for the 2011 indexed minimum wage increase (approximately 10-cents)<ref>{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012948503_aporminimumwageoregon.html | work=Oregonian | title=Oregon's minimum wage to increase 10 cents in 2011 | date=September 20, 2010}}</ref> was announced by state Labor Commissioner [[Brad Avakian]] in September 2010, the OCPP advocated the increase as a needed boost for the state's poor. The group also pointed out that the wage hike would act as a counterbalance to the coming state tax increase for gas and diesel.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/updates/25316765-55/tax-gas-oregon-cents-hike.csp | work=Register Guard | title=Gasoline tax: The state will add 6 cents more per gallon | date=September 21, 2010}}</ref>

The OCPP has also contributed to debate about Oregon's state budget and suggested tax increases as a way to help plug budget deficits.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=15209 | work=Stateline.org | title=Oregon Budget Woes Grow As Options Dwindle | date=April 4, 2003}}</ref> In January 2010, state voters in Oregon approved two ballot proposals, [[Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67 (2010)|Measure 66 and Measure 67]], that raised taxes on businesses (that make at least $250,000 per year) and households (that make at least $125,000 per year). The OCPP had pushed for these tax increases and said the campaign in Oregon was "a template" for other states that were also considering a number of tax increases.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/us/28oregon.html?_r=1 | work=New York Times | title=Voters in Oregon Approve Tax Increases | date=January 27, 2010 | first=William | last=Yardley}}</ref>

The group has urged the Oregon state legislature to improve the state [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] (EITC) to help provide tax relief to the state's low-income workers, families, and children.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://salem-news.com/articles/october212010/oregon-priorities-cs.php | work=Salem News | title=It's a matter of priorities | first=Chuck | last=Sheketoff | date=October 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2010/01/the_next_steps_on_the_path_to.html | work=Oregonian | title=The next steps on the path to Oregon's recovery | first=Chuck | last=Sheketoff | date=January 31, 2010}}</ref>
