The '''House of Commons''' is the name of the elected [[lower house]] of the [[bicameral]] [[parliament]]s of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]] and historically was the name of the lower houses of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Northern Ireland]], and [[North Carolina]]. Roughly equivalent bodies in other countries which were once [[British colony|British colonies]] or federations thereof include the [[United States House of Representatives]], the [[Australian House of Representatives]], the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]], and India's [[Lok Sabha]].

In the UK and Canada, the Commons holds much more legislative power than the respective [[upper house]] of parliament. The leader of the majority party in the House of Commons usually becomes the [[prime minister]]. Since 2010 the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] has had 650 elected members. The [[House of Commons of Canada]] has 308 members,<ref>http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/process/house/partystandings/standings-E.htm</ref> increasing to 338 members on October 2015. The Commons' functions are to consider through debate new laws and changes to existing ones, authorise taxes,  and provide scrutiny of the policy and expenditure of the Government. It has the power to give a Government a [[vote of no confidence]].

==History and naming==
The [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] evolved from an undivided parliament to serve as the voice of the tax-paying subjects of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|counties]] and of the [[borough constituency|boroughs]]. [[Knight of the shire|Knights of the shire]], elected from each county, were usually landowners, while the borough members were often from the merchant classes. These members represented subjects of [[the Crown]] who were not Lords Temporal or Spiritual, who themselves sat in the [[House of Lords]]. The House of Commons gained its name because it represented communities (''communes'').<ref>[[A. F. Pollard]], ''The Evolution of Parliament'' (Longmans, 1920), 107–08.</ref> Members of the Commons were all elected, while members of the upper house were summoned to parliament by the monarch, usually on the basis of a [[peerage of England|title]] which would be inherited after the holder's death, or because they held a position in the realm that warranted special recognition, such as the [[bishop]]s of the English and Welsh [[diocese]]s. After the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], these bishops were those of the [[Church of England]].

Since the 19th century, the British and Canadian Houses of Commons have become increasingly representative, as [[suffrage]] has been extended.  Both bodies are now elected via [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]]. However, from the [[Middle Ages]] until the 18th century there was a tendency to limit the suffrage in various ways, creating by the 18th century a large number of [[rotten borough]]s. In all countries, the House of Commons now as in the past may be [[Legislative session|prorogued]] for an election or some other purpose only by the Crown, represented outside the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Governor General]] of each [[Commonwealth realm]].
