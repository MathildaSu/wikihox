'''''Le Mani Destre Recise Degli Ultimi Uomini''''' (The Severed Right Hands of the Last Men) is the sixth album by the heavily conceptual American band [[Secret Chiefs 3]] (operating here as '''Traditionalists''', one of the seven satellite bands introduced on Secret Chiefs 3’s album ''[[Book of Horizons]]''). The album is a paranoiac soundtrack to an imaginary [[Giallo film|Giallo horror film]]. The album contains 30 tracks of original music inspired by Italian film composers including [[Bruno Nicolai]], [[Stelvio Cipriani]], [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] and [[Piero Piccioni]]. The album marks the first full-length release by one of the Secret Chiefs 3 satellite bands. Previously, three of the seven satellite bands, UR, The Electromagnetic Azoth and Ishraqiyun have released limited edition 7" EPs. ''Le Mani Destre Recise Degli Ultimi Uomini'' also had a limited vinyl release.<ref>[http://webofmimicry.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=24&products_id=79 Web of Mimicry Online Store: Traditionalists: Le Mani Destre Recise Degli Ultimi Uomini CD]</ref>
