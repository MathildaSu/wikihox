==Plot==
The movie charts the emotional journey of Arjun (Manoj Tiwari). A college student with dreams of becoming an IPS officer, Arjun is basically a son of the soil. One day, when he is coming back to his village on a vacation with his bosom friend Deepak, a car accident changes his life dramatically. Deepak, who is driving the car, happens to run over a villager, Shankar, who subsequently succumbs to his injuries. Arjun, however, insists on taking the blame on himself and surrenders to the police.

Even as he does this, he is aware that by doing so, he is not merely distancing himself from his dreams but also from his beloved Rajni (Sharbani Mukherjee). In his darkest hour, SP Kunal Singh (Ajay Devgan) enters his life like sunlight and obtains his conditional freedom. What also draws Arjun and Kunal close to each other is their distaste for the activities of the village bully, Veer Mongia.

Kunal inspires Arjun to fight Veer Mongia in the village election. How Kunal (Who is also in the guise of a dacoit, Kanhaiyya) manages to turn the tables on Veer Mongia and how Arjun finally escapes from the shadow of guilt, form the climax.
