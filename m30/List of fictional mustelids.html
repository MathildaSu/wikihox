{{dynamic list}}

The following '''list of fictional [[Mustelidae|mustelids]]''' is subsidiary to the [[list of fictional animals]]. This list is limited solely to notable ''non-badger'' and ''non-raccoon'' characters that appear in works of fiction and that are in the [[musteloidea]] superfamily of mammals. This includes [[weasel]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[mink]]s, [[otter]]s, [[marten]]s, and [[skunk]]s.

All fictional [[badger]]s are found within the [[list of fictional badgers]].

Fictional [[Raccoons]] are found in the [[list of fictional raccoons]].

If a character appears in more than one medium, sort under the primary one. Thus, despite occasional appearances in licenced video games, [[Pepe Le Pew]] is listed under the [[list of fictional mustelids in animation]].
