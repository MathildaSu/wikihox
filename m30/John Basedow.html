Times}}</ref>

==Biography==
Basedow got his start as a reporter on a New York nightly news program and then co-created an internationally syndicated TV show called ''Images''.  ''Images'' was a magazine format half hour television series that dealt with health-related topics. Basedow and his co-host, Paquita McCray, syndicated the program to over 200 U.S. TV stations and 30 foreign countries while Basedow was still in school.

After ''Images'', Basedow, who then described his body as a "bowling pin on legs", set a goal to get in good enough shape to appear in a fitness magazine. After frustration with different exercise routines, fad diets, and overhyped supplements, he sat down and invented his own regimen, which came to be ''Fitness Made Simple''. By following the ''Fitness Made Simple'' program, Basedow achieved his goal and has been featured in most every national exercise-related publication. His story was profiled in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the Fitness Made Simple brand currently consists of 9 DVDs, various CDs and a book. Basedow also appeared on ''Fit Living'', a TV program in the Metro New York area, where he offered viewers training tips and meal plans from the ''Fitness Made Simple'' program.  He now provides exercise and nutrition tips on over 30 TV and radio programs nationwide each month and can be seen frequently as a guest on Fox News Channel.

Basedow is known to be very modest about his status as a fitness celebrity.{{whom|date=April 2015}} In an article with the ''[[Iowa State Daily]]'', he says:
<blockquote>...it's so hard to believe - that I'm a popular icon. The [[New York Times]] was funny. Not too long ago I was on the front page. It wasn't even a story about me, it was about celebrity poker. The first line of the story said "If you thought the next great television phenomenon after [[NASCAR]], [[figure skating]] and [[Physical fitness|fitness]] personality John Basedow would be celebrity poker, people would have said you were crazy." The fact that they grouped me with those things blew my mind.<ref>[http://www.iowastatedaily.com/media/storage/paper818/news/2006/01/24/Pulse/Fitness.Made.Basedow-1502340.shtml?norewrite200606221434&sourcedomain=www.iowastatedaily.com "Fitness Made Basedow"] Iowa State Daily: 2006-01-24{{dead|date=April 2015}}</ref>
