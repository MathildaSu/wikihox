== Style of Play ==
An opportunist striker with a fiery temperament. Demetriou's direct style of running is one of many weapons in his arsenal. He possesses a right-footed strike which will, if uncontested, find its way into the back of the net more often than not. Demetriou is unafraid to drive at the penalty area, usually playing off the last man and possessing the crucial ability to anticipate the ball.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seG3uE36SsU|title=Demetriou Nottingham Forest Goals|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>
