Between 1998 and 2002 Axe also created several of the internets first battle rap websites which greatly increased the popularity of the rap battle scene. Battle leagues such as Ell Oh Crew, New Jerusalem, Sacred Society, Ground Zero, and The Chamber were extremely popular among rookie and veteran battlers in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/195958.html|title=Ell Oh Crew Battle league}}</ref>

Axe retired with an impressive 44-1 record in 2008. While no longer a battle rapper he still continues to manage the production of Sacred Society albums and mixtapes.

In August 2015, Axe released the first tracks to the tribute album ''Random Price'' to honor the passing of [[Duck Down Music Inc.|Duck Down records]] artist [[Sean Price]] who is a member of the rap trio [[Random Axe]].

==Sacred Society Battle League==
In 1999, battlers Fam Nice and Axe who were members of Ell Oh Crew, branched out to create the forum style version of battle rap that is currently used today with their leagues Sacred Society (formerly known as New Jerusalem). Those sites conducted battle rap in both audio and text. However, it was first and foremost a battle league. Sacred Society had interviews, hip hop news, tournaments with rookie and pro levels known as the ''Boot Camp'' and the ''Gravel Pit'' and big yearly tournaments were known as '''Pay-Per-View'''. There was a cash pot and the winner took all. PPV 8 was the last of these tournaments. Battlers were also ranked and competed for the top position known as the '''"Supreme Lyricist"''' on a monthly basis. The '''"Esco Award"''' was given on a monthly basis as well for the emcee with the grimiest, darkest content and style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sacredsociety66120.yuku.com|title=Sacred Society Battle league}}</ref>

Young who is also a veteran of the [[Iraq War]] founded the non-profit organization [[OTH Veterans Services]] which is the only veterans support organization in the U.S. that totally specializes in assisting the 1.2 million veterans with an [[Military discharge|Other Than Hononorable discharge]].

According to the organizations website, Young started the project due to wide spread misinformation about OTH discharges and lack of support from the VA and other veterans organizations for OTH discharged veterans. Many of these veterans suffer from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] and combat injuries for which they receive no support or VA disability compensation.

As of November 2015, the organization claims to have helped return nearly $106 million worth of benefits to veterans and their families and won a 2014 [[Marquis Who's Who| Marquis Who's Who Award]] for ''Outstanding Veterans Services''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Sam|title=OTH Veterans Services - About Page|url=https://otherthanhonorabledischarge.wordpress.com/about-oth-veterans-services/about-oth-veterans-services/|website=OTH Veterans Services|publisher=Wordpress}}</ref>
