===Consulting===
In 1973 Katz founded a company to provide consulting services to universities, public bodies and NGOs. He started this business while studying in Memphis, then sold it prior to moving to Michigan. He then set up J.A. Katz Associates, currently operating in St Louis, in 1976. The firm consults on entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial development and entrepreneurship education to NGOs, large and small businesses. 
===Billiken Angels Network===
In 2008 Katz founded the Billiken Angels Network as part of Saint Louis University’s entrepreneurship program. The network is an [[angel investor]] process which aims to pair up potential investors with startup businesses, so they can provide them with capital and expertise. In exchange investors receive equity or dividends from the business. It also runs workshops for businesses seeking funding.<ref>[http://www.stltoday.com/suburban-journals/metro/news/billiken-angel-network-to-host-funding-workshop/article_3f9b1d71-5a49-5229-8eb4-00239d680065.html Billiken Angel Network to host funding workshop]. St Louis Post-Dispatch (retrieved Dec 8, 2014).</ref>
Billiken Angels differs from most angel investors in two ways. First it offers small investments of as low as $5,000 to businesses started by SLU students. Second, the group uses an additional network of volunteers, called Billiken Angel Fellows, to perform screening and due diligence on behalf of the angels. The university itself is an active partner in the network and has allocated $1 million for investment in its projects.<ref>Billiken Angels Network, [http://www.billikenangels.com/ban-faqs.html BAN FAQs] (retrieved Dec 8, 2014).</ref>

Katz believes that much of the post-2008 entrepreneurship boom in Missouri is fuelled by necessity, as people become self-employed or freelance as a response to losing their previous jobs.<ref>Nicklaus, David. [http://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/david-nicklaus/missouri-goes-from-laggard-to-leader-in-entrepreneurship/article_485be392-7466-11e1-8066-001a4bcf6878.html Missouri goes from laggard to leader in entrepreneurship]. St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Retrieved Dec 8, 2014). </ref> He has expressed concerns that while these are counted as new businesses they are unlikely to ever hire anyone, and will be wound up if their founders can find a salaried job. He also identifies undercapitalization as a major risk for necessity-driven startups.<ref>Nicklaus, David.
