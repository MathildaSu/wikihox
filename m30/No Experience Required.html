'''''No Experienced Required''''' is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTE]] [[reality television]] series that debuted on [[RTÉ Two]] in February 2006.

== Seasons ==

The first season consisted of 6 episodes. The series offered 3 individuals with no experience in the relevant fields the opportunity to win the job of their dreams. In each episode the 3 finalists would partake in 2 weeks work experience and the finalist who impressed the employer the most would secure a six month contract with the firm.
Jobs on the line were Reporter, Chef, Sports Trader, Fashion Buyer, Interior Designer, and Advertising Creative.

e.g. In episode six, Sinead Kenefick won a six month contract with the [[Irish Daily Star]], beating fellow contestants Paul McSherry and Aaron Long.
