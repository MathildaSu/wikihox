'''Abandoned vehicles''' are [[decrepit car|decrepit]] cars or cars that have become useless in other ways, which are [[abandonment (legal)|abandoned]] and [[illegal dumping|illegally dumped]] in the environment. Abandoned vehicles will be tagged with an official notice when found or reported.<ref>https://www.gov.uk/report-abandoned-vehicle</ref> Criteria for "abandonment" may differ, and a minimum duration of abandonment on the order of a few days to weeks is required.<ref>http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Title-to-an-Abandoned-Vehicle</ref> <ref name=nolo>http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/dealing-with-abandoned-vehicles-your-neighborhood.html</ref> When reporting such a vehicle, the required data will usually comprise the exact location, the make, colour and type, and - if available and readable - possibly the [[VIN number]] and the [[licence plate]]. Costs for removal will as a rule be taken by public councils.
