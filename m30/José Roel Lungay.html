==Biography==

===Early life===
José Roel Lungay, fondly called Father Roel or Fro, was born to José Racho Lungay of [[Balilihan, Bohol|Balilihan]], Bohol and Amelia Fernandez Galicia of [[San Jose, Occidental Mindoro|San Jose]], [[Occidental Mindoro|Mindoro Occidental]]. His father, a product of [[FEATI University]] in Manila,  was a long-time public servant having served as Area Equipment Engineer of [[Regions of the Philippines#.5B.5BVisayas.5D.5D|Region 7]] of the [[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Highways]] (DPH) until his retirement, while his mother, a [[St. Paul University Manila|St. Paul College]] alum, was a devoted homemaker tending all 10 of her children. Father Roel, born in [[Manila]], was raised in [[Tagbilaran City]], [[Bohol]]. He attended [[kindergarten]] (1964–1966) in [[Bulacan|Marulas, Bulacan]] and [[Manila|Sampaloc, Manila]].  For his [[Primary education|elementary education]], his  Grades 1 and 2 (1966–1968) were at Catigbian Elementary School Annex, Catigbian, Bohol. His Grades 3 to 6 (1968–1972) were at Cogon Elementary School, Tagbilaran City, graduating from  elementary at Cogon Elementary School.  He attended the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary]] in Tagbilaran City for both his [[secondary school]] (1972–1976) and [[college]] (1976–1980) where he earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Arts major in [[Ancient philosophy|classical philosophy]], minor in [[English language|English]]. He also took up a few subjects in [[architecture]] at the [[University of Bohol]] before deciding to go back to the seminary.  For his [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] studies, he proceeded to the [[SASMA|Saint Augustine Major Seminary]] (SASMA) and the [[Divine Word Seminary]] in [[Tagaytay City]] where he earned his degree in [[theology]].

While still a student at the Divine Word Seminary in Tagaytay City, between the years 1981 to 1985, Roel became involved with works among the underprivileged. As a seminarian he always chose for his apostolates an opportunity to be with the poor or the so-called ''grassroots'' people. For four years he worked in different areas like Ternate; Bagong Bayan, Dasmarinas (a Resettlement area); Malagasang, Imus; Andrea, Bacoor and Rosario, Cavite. Both as a seminarian and as a priest he took part in organizing, between 1984–1986, the first People Power in the Southern Tagalog and Central Luzon Regions.

After finishing his third year in theology studies he was ordained, at age 23, a deacon for the Diocese of Tagbilaran on February 28, 1983 at the [[St. Joseph]] [[Cathedral]], Tagbilaran City.  He went back to the seminary the following year and was ordained to the priesthood, on December 7, 1984, at the [[Immaculate Conception]] [[Church (building)|Church]] in [[Catigbian, Bohol]] by then bishop of Tagbilaran, Most Rev. Onesimo Gordoncillo, D.D., currently the [[Archbishop]] of [[Capiz]]. He became the first priest ordained in that town. Shortly after ordination he went back to the seminary again to finish his studies until his graduation on March 1985. He received his first pastoral assignment when his bishop, now [[Capiz|Archbishop of Capiz]], Most. Rev. Onesino Gordoncillo, D.D., sent him to the [[Cabanatuan City|Diocese of Cabanatuan]] which was in need of priestly help. He was assigned as assistant priest of St. Nicholas de Tolentino Cathedral in Cabanatuan City for one full year.

Back when the Diocese of Tagbilaran was being split into two ecclesiastical Dioceses in 1986, Father Roel came home to Bohol for reassignment. Since the Bishop of Tagbilaran at that time was already being named the Archbishop-elect of the Archdiocese of Capiz, he deferred assigning Father Roel to a new station and told him instead to wait until the next bishop to arrive. The Diocese finally split that year and two new bishops were named for both the old Diocese of Tagbilaran and the new [[Diocese of Talibon]]: Most Rev. Felix Zafra, D.D. for Tagbilaran and Most Rev. Cristian Noel, D.D. for [[Talibon, Bohol|Talibon]]. It was during this time that Fr. Roel opted instead to visit with his family in [[San Francisco]] for which he was granted permission by then [[Vicar capitular|Diocesan Administrator]], Msgr Pelagio Dompor, J.C.D. with the approval of the [[Consultor|Priests Consultors]] of the Diocese.{{clear}}

===Career===
[[Image:Jubilaeum2000A.jpg|thumb|right|225pix| Fr. Roel, SPOT and Seminarians during Jubilaeum 2000 Concert in Tagbilaran City (8/00)]]
Father Roel began writing lyric and poetry in college while attending the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary. It was when he started playing the guitar more seriously that he slowly translated his lyrical works into full-pledged songs and it has been a long journey from then on.

After spending a year of sabbatical from the seminary in 1980 and working with evicted squatters at San Jose Resettlement Area in [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]], [[Cavite]],  Father Roel entered the St. Augustine Major Seminary (SASMA) in 1981. There, he started writing liturgical settings of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] both in English and in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].<ref name="misasma">[http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=652161 ''MISASMA (SASMASSONGS) (1982)''], the official hymnal of St. Augustine Major Seminary (1982)</ref> He was one of the first composers to write a musical setting for the new Tagalog Missal, ''Bagong Misal'', which was approved in 1982 but initially faced a considerable amount of opposition in its early years, especially in the Manila area. However, his new setting continued to be taught and sung at SASMA and in some Dioceses where SASMA seminarians came from. In 1983, the Archdiocesan Commission on Liturgical Music (ACLM), [[Archdiocese of Manila]] <ref name="hosanna">''Hosanna, III (1983''), the official publication of the Archdiocesan Commission on Liturgical Music (ACLM), [[Archdiocese of Manila]], [[Philippines]]</ref> published some of his songs in its third hymnal publication, ''Hosanna III'', approved by Cardinal Archbishop of Manila, [[Jaime Sin]]. Fr. Roel was also voted by the seminarians as music director of SASMA in 1982 during which he initiated the publication of the seminary's hymnal, ''SASMASSONGS (MISASMA)''. In 1984, along with Fr. William Abas who was the lyricist, he wrote the music and arrangement to ''[http://www.esnips.com/doc/392da231-b417-40c6-b880-89adc4783883/Handog-Paglilingkod-(Original-Version) Handog-Paglilingkod (Service Offering)]''<ref>''[http://www.esnips.com/doc/392da231-b417-40c6-b880-89adc4783883/Handog-Paglilingkod-(Original-Version) Original live version of Handog-Paglilingkod]'' performed by SASMA Seminarians 1984</ref>  which became the official theme song of SASMA that very year. Some of his works were included in the Diocesan hymnal of the Diocese Cabanatuan,<ref name="papuri">''Papuri ng Nueva Ecija (1986),'' the official publication of the Diocesan Liturgical Commission, Diocese of Cabanatuan, Philippines</ref> while serving there as an assistant priest of the Cathedral. He was also inserted as a member of the Diocese's singing group of young priests that included Fr. Monet Mangahas from U.S.T. Central Seminary, Fr. Rene Mangahas from San Jose Seminary (Ateneo) and Fr. Edwin Beley, also of San Jose Seminary, who played bass in the first studio recording of the Philippines Jesuits, the ''[[Jesuit Music Ministry|Himig Heswita.]]''
[[Image:Jubilaeum2000B.jpg|thumb|right|225pix| Fr. Roel's rendition of TQ Solis Jr.'s ''One Heart, One Mind'' during the gala night of Jubilaeum 2000 at DWCT Gym]]
In the Archdiocese of New Orleans, Father Roel helped the formation of the Singing Priests of Louisiana together with three other Paring Bol-anons: Fr. Jaime Apolinares, Fr. Danilo Digal and Fr. Joel Cantones, as counterpart to the pioneering Singing Priests of San Francisco. The group debuted in 1988 during the 3rd Paring Bol-anon, USA Reunion with a concert in [[Brooklyn, New York]], followed by a performance at the [[United Nations headquarters|United Nations Auditorium]] in 1988. As the group's accompanist and arranger, Father Roel engaged himself to more vocal arrangements for the group, which eventually landed them a spot in New Orleans' [[WWL-TV|WWL-TV Channel 4's]] ''Christmas Around The World'' program back in 1989. The group also performed at various Filipino Community functions as well as traveled to neighboring states of Texas and Mississippi doing Christmas carols and helped raise funds for the needs of the Diocese and the seminary in the Philippines. The Singing Priests of Louisiana finally disbanded in August 1990 after a performance at the IHMS Silver Jubilee Celebration in Tagbilaran City. Father Roel's last recorded performance was on August 2000 during which he sang the popular [[Dan Schutte]] composition, ''Here I Am, Lord,'' with the [[Singing Priests of Tagbilaran]] and IHMS Neo-Jeduthun Chorus, and TQ Solis' original composition, ''One Heart, One Mind,''<ref>''[http://www.soundclick.com/bands/songInfo.cfm?bandID=649606&songID=4873247 One Heart, One Mind]'', Theme Song of the 8th Paring Bol-anon, USA Reunion, Toronto, Canada; written by TQ Solis, Jr.</ref> in a two-night concert dubbed as ''Jubilaeum 2000,'' celebrating the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary|Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary's]] 50th Foundation anniversary.

As an avid songwriter, Father Roel had also participated in some songwriting contests over the years. Besides writing the winning song for 1984 SASMA Theme, he also won first place in the 1995 NFCMWA Christian Music Songwriting Contest in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] with the song ''[http://www.esnips.com/doc/20f5e258-1ea0-46d8-9066-dfe997fe9c85/Dear-Jesus Dear Jesus]'' and an honorable mention in the Trailblazer Category of the 1995 Airplay International Country Songwriting Contest, [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] with his song, ''[http://www.esnips.com/doc/6f22870c-31d7-48c7-a811-d00a77ab226f/Sailboat Sailboat].'' From 1992 to 1996 Father Roel has also produced and released four [[Compilation album|compilations]] of [[original]] songs written by him, ''[http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=651211 Mass of St. Rita] (1994)'', ''[http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=650022 Dear Jesus] (1994),'' ''[http://frosmusic.homestead.com/mr1album.html Music Revisited, Vol. 1] (1995)'' and one he did with other Paring Bol-anon or PBs like Frs. TQ Solis, Jr. Elpidio Biliran, Jr. and [[Arnold Zamora]], ''[http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=649606 One Heart, One Mind] (1996).''

Since becoming pastor of St. Genevieve Church in Slidell in 1991, Father Roel has focused most of his time on pastoral duties. He helped in the establishment of the new Gospel Choir in the parish and the transition of a children's choir to a youth choir.{{clear}}

===Post Katrina life and ministry===


In mid-July 2005, Father Roel underwent surgery for his thyroid at Northshore Hospital in Slidell. Having lost his voice as a result of the surgery, he had to spend a five-week official leave of absence by the Archdiocese to rest his barely heard voice and to recuperate. It was while he was in the Philippines, on August 29, 2005, when the biggest natural disaster to ever hit the United States - [[Hurricane Katrina]] - struck the whole gulf south region that annihilated almost everything that stood by its way. Suffice it to say, that Father Roel not only lost everything he owned but also the very church he was given charge of and the rectory that he lived in. St. Genevieve Church is gone and no more!<ref>''[http://www.angelfire.com/la3/judyb/bayoupix.html Bayou Liberty Post-Hurricane Katrina Photos]'' Retrieved online 16 January 2007</ref>

As an ecclesiastical parish St. Genevieve in Slidell is a close-knit faith community on the northeastern part of [[Lake Ponchartrain]] just west of [[Mississippi]]. It comprises some 1,500 to 2,000 Catholic households, a local airport, the one and only mall in Slidell and other commercial entities. Built in 1958, the church building had been a long-standing center of many activities of the local people as well as newcomers to the area. It is considered to be one of the most scenic of churches in and of New Orleans by the mere fact that it stands right on the bank of Bayou Liberty, one of many tributaries of Lake Ponchartrain, across an old marina. The surroundings, too, is well-adorned with centuries-old oak trees and a vast marshlands and waterways Louisiana is known for.

A week or two after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the people, scattered all over the country during the evacuation, started to come home slowly to pick up the pieces and commenced the road to recovery. On Sundays, parishioners gathered on the church ground where Mass is celebrated with priest helping from a nearby parish. For almost two months St. Genevieve, without its pastor, Fr. Roel, was reminiscent of the [[St. Genevieve Church|old mission church]] that it used to be, celebrating liturgy on the very spot where the old chapel was in the early 1900 under the hot humid sky.<ref name="tp">''[http://www.nola.com/archives/t-p/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1131606006166260.xml&coll=1 Times Picayune]'' Retrieved online 16 January 2007</ref>

Father Roel came back home to St. Genevieve on Tuesday, November 1, [[All Saints' Day|the Feast of All Saints]]. He celebrated his first post-Katrina Mass that weekend which also happened to be the last Mass being celebrated outdoors as parishioners readied themselves to move indoor, inside the dilapidated Parish Hall, in preparation for the winter season. Father Roel reminded the parishioners that even without the buildings they are still a church, emphasizing that the people who gathered in the Lord's name is what truly comprised a church.<ref name="tp"/>
