'''DinuraCreations''' is a [[Colombo]] [[Sri Lanka|LK]] based<ref>{{cite web|title=Directory of registered NGO's Sri Lanka|url=http://www.ngosecretarit.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_statistics&Itemid=67&lang=en}}</ref> None-Governmental Organization ([[NGO]]) dedicated to the preservation of audio visual contents and South Asia's traditional texts,<ref>{{cite web|title=Unknown Chotā Nāgpur|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/lsi/3300AK}}</ref> those with significant cultural value, used with the historic versions of the [[Sinhala]] [[Gramophone]] songs recorded before 1948 which are rarely used or unused in common practice today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pradeep's remarkable collection of old records|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/04/30/mag04.html}}</ref> Basically these contents are related to Buddhism and folklore of Sri Lanka of which the authors are mostly unknown and in the [[public domain]].

==The profile==
It was founded in 1998 namely the Gramophone Text Archive, parallel to the cultural centres island-wide<ref>{{cite web|title=Cultural Centers Function Under the Ministry|url=http://www.cultural.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=100&Itemid=79&lang=en}}</ref> in 90 s by Dinura Pradeep Balasooriya and late prof. AV Suraweera,<ref>{{cite web|title=A.V. Suraweera, 1930-|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/avsuraweera.html}}</ref> who was a scholar writer, the Director General of the Central Cultural Fund<ref>{{cite web|title= Central Cultural Fund|url=http://www.ccf.lk/}}</ref> and was earlier Deputy Minister of Culture and Religious Affairs of Sri Lanka as a project planned to launch a governmental funded project to keep the ancient and traditional textual applications safer against the modern non-literal gossipy trends.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elu langauge and ancient Sri Lanka|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/elu.html}}</ref> But that plan was not fully implemented instead a range of cultural centres was established. In 2006, the project was re-organized as a part of an Eastern Languages Promotion Programme.

==Functions==
Currently the organization has archived physically 132 unique Sinhala gramophone text documents, some of them back dated to 1929 published under the lable of "[[His Master's Voice]]" (HMV). However they are not yet published as electronic public domain texts. An instant document is available online named Thilona Sesi Muni Gauthama Swami. All the printed texts are used for educational purposes only.
