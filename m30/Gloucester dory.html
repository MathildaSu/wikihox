The '''Gloucester dory''' is a variant of the [[Banks dory]], a type of narrow-bottomed, slab-sided boat, common in the North Eastern United States.  It is characteristically smaller and lighter, with less overhang, both bow and stern, and less [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]].  It retains the [[Banks dory]]'s slab sides.  [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]] dories were designed to be launched through the surf behind a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] for daily [[fishing]] and [[lobster fishing|lobstering]] off the [[Massachusetts]] shore.  

Because of its simple lines, a Gloucester dory is relatively easy to build.  With the straight sides and flat bottom, [[stitch and glue]] techniques work well with this boat.
