The '''Flexible Support Fund''' is a a fund in the United Kingdom to aid those in receipt of unemployment benefits to gain employment. It can be used for the cost of travel to interviews, childcare, tools and clothing and uniforms to start work.<ref>https://about.universalcredit.service.gov.uk/kms/Pages/Flexible_Support_Fund.htm</ref> However, there is no exhaustive list of things that may be funded under the fund.

The Flexible Support fund replaces a range of Job Centre Plus schemes including the  Deprived Areas Fund, the Adviser Discretion Fund and the Travel to Interview Scheme.<ref name=RB /> Under the Flexible Support Fund Job Centres have greater freedom to tailer their support to local need. A second part of the Flexible Support Fund allows Dictrict Managers to award funding to "partnership organisations" in order to address barriers to work.<ref name=RB>http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06079</ref> 

==Controversy==
An undercover investigation published in The Daily Mirror newspaper revealed that Department for Work and Pensions civil servants were being told not to mention to fund so as to minimise the number of claims:

"It's a bit like Fight Club - we don't discuss what happens in Fight Club.So you don't talk about flexible support fund either."<ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-staff-go-strike-6061541</ref></blockquote>
