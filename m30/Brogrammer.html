A '''brogrammer''' ([[portmanteau]] of [[bro (subculture)|bro]] and [[programmer]]) is a term thought to describe a [[macho]] programmer. A brogrammer might self-describe as a sociable programmer.<ref name="bw">{{cite web|author=Douglas MacMillan|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-01/the-rise-of-the-brogrammer |title=The Rise of the 'Brogrammer' |publisher=Businessweek |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/64050/brogrammer |title=brogrammer Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia |publisher=Pcmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref> An example sometimes cited is an early [[Klout]] hiring advert posted at a [[Stanford University]] career fair as "Want to bro down and crush some code?

The subculture has been criticized by ''[[The Atlantic]]'''s Jordan Weissmann, who blamed the shrinking proportion of women in programming in the last two decades on the "brogrammer effect".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jordan Weissmann|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-brogrammer-effect-women-are-a-small-and-shrinking-share-of-computer-workers/279611/ |title=The Brogrammer Effect: Women Are a Small (and Shrinking) Share of Computer Workers|publisher=The Atlantic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref> Similar articles in the Atlantic have also advocated strongly for the importance of an egalitarian tech team.<ref>{{cite web|author=Derek Thompson|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/01/the-secret-to-smart-groups-isnt-smart-people/384625/ |title=The Secret to Smart Groups: It's Women |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2015-01-18}}</ref> According to research published in Fortune, 27% of women cited workplace culture as a reason for leaving jobs in the technology industry, whereas 68% cited motherhood as a reason.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kieran Snyder|url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/ |title=Why women leave tech: It's the culture, not because 'math is hard'|publisher=Forbes.com |date=2014-10-02 |accessdate=2015-02-09}}</ref> The decline in women entering the tech field in the first place has been blamed on a shift in how computers and their industry are marketed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding|title=When Women Stopped Coding|first=Steve|last=Henn|publisher=NPR|date=2014-10-21|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jaxenter.com/when-women-stopped-programming-111998.html|title=1984: The year women stopped programming|first=Coman|last=Hamilton|date=2014-11-07|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> In a dissenting piece in [[Gizmodo]], Sam Biddle argues that the effect of the brogrammer culture has been overblown by the press.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sam Biddle|url=http://gizmodo.com/5910824/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-brogrammer |title=There's No Such Thing as a Brogrammer |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref>
