Allen Bevins Reed was born in [[Liberty, Missouri]], on April 3, 1884, the oldest of four children of [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] [[Sheriff]] James French Reed (1852-1909) and Fannie G. (Wymore) Reed (1857-1936), married on March 28, 1883.<ref>[http://files.usgwarchives.net/mo/clay/newspapers/marriage215gnw.txt The Liberty Tribune, March 30, 1883]</ref> He was named for his grandfather, Captain Allen Grigsby Reed (1812-1899). Graduating from [[Liberty High School (Liberty, Missouri)|Liberty High School]] in 1900, Allen B.

Kimmel]], [[commander]] of [[United States Pacific Fleet]] at the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

Completing his academic studies at the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]], Reed received his [[warrant officer|warrant]] as a [[passed midshipman]].  On January 25, 1904 he was detached from [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] "to home and ready for sea".<ref>National Archives and Records Administration, "Transcript of Service of Allen Bevins Reed, Commander (T) USN", March 20, 1920</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F40C10FC34591B728DDDAA0A94DC405B838CF1D3 N.Y.

==U.S. Naval service==

===Asiatic fleet===
[[File:Midshipman Allen B. Reed.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Midshipman Allen B. Reed in 1904]]

In 1905, as a 21-year-old passed midshipman, Reed was given the coveted assignment of second-in-command of a vessel, the 30-man [[gunboat]], {{USS|Paragua|1888|6}}, [[Ensign]] Charles S. Kerrick, commanding.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/registercommiss20deptgoog#page/n195/mode/1up Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the Navy of the United States and Marine Corps, January 1906, pp. 188]</ref> ''Paragua'' was part of the [[Philippine Department#US Navy and USMC|Philippine Squadron]] of the [[Asiatic Fleet]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f2A7AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_atb_hover&pg=GBS.PA388 Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy, 1905, p. 388]</ref>  that along with other ships in the "[[mosquito fleet]]" of mostly seized ex-Spanish gunboats and steam yachts, patrolled the [[Philippine Islands]] primarily south of [[Mindanao]] in the [[Sulu Archipelago]] to intercept [[pirates]], [[gunrunners]], [[slave-traders]] and support [[U.S. Army]] and local [[Philippine Constabulary]] ground forces during the [[Moro Rebellion]] of 1899-1913.  

During the [[Third Sulu Expedition]] in May 1905, the gunboat transported the provisional company of the US Army's 17th Infantry to Pata Island on an expedition to kill or capture a [[Moro people|Moro]] chieftain whose tribe had been robbing other islanders to the point that the [[panglima]] in charge of the island had requested the army's assistance. Midshipman Reed volunteered to accompany the expedition ashore and acted as signal officer to the gunboat using "wig-wag" flags and controlled the gunfire on a part of the firing line at the [[Battle of Pata Island on May 13, 1905]]. During the fighting the rifle of a soldier standing by Reed became jammed and the midshipman gave him his sidearm to fire. Reed was commended by the army company commander in his report to [[Major General]] [[Leonard Wood]], who in his report commended ''Paragua'' for its assistance in the expedition. Promoted to ensign on February 2, 1906, Reed assumed command of ''Paragua'' that same day from Kerrick. 

On December 14, 1906, Reed detached from ''Paragua'' to the [[protected cruiser]] {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|}}, cruising Asiatic, Philippine and Australian waters before returning to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|New York Navy Yard]] on April 26, 1907.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70717FE385A15738DDDAE0A94DC405B878CF1D3 New York Times, "Baltimore Home from Far Off Seas", April 27, 1907]</ref><ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015036626235;view=image;seq=470;num=200;q1=%22allen%20b.%20reed%22;start=1;size=10;page=search Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the Navy of the United States and Marine Corps, January 1907, p. 200]</ref>
