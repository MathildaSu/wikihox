'''Aurthohin (অর্থহীন)''' is a Bangladeshi hard rock and metal band formed in 1998 by bassist, singer and songwriter [[Khaled 'Bassbaba' Sumon|Sumon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bengali/multimedia/2012/04/120423_mb_gaangolpo_orthohin.shtml | title=ঢাকার রক ব্যান্ড অর্থহীন | publisher=[[BBC Bangla]] | accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref> He is the only founding member still with the band. Aurthohin are known for their mix of melodic acoustic numbers and extremely heavy metal numbers in their albums often containing lots of bass slaps, taps and solos.{{cn|date=January 2014}} They have released six albums. In 2008 they released their album ''[[Aushomapto 1]]'' and its sequel in 2011 ''Aushomapto 2''. Their current lineup is Sumon on vocals and bass, Rafa on vocals and drums, and Shishir on guitar and keyboard.

==History==
The idea of a band, and the name of the band, Aurthohin, came from Sumon's solo project, ''Sumon O Aurthohin''. The album, released while Sumon was still a member of Bangladeshi metal pioneers [[Warfaze]], featured vocals and bass work by Sumon and a slew of guest artists and musicians. One particular track, the titular "Aurthohin", featured eight of the most prominent guitarists of the era playing a collection of 27 solos, while the vocals were supplied by the then-vocalist of [[Warfaze]], [[Sunjoy]]. The name of the band came from that track, leading into his first album as a band [[Trimatrik]] ("Three-Dimensional", in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]).

===''Trimatrik'' (1999-2000)===
The album featured a confusing line-up of musicians, since Sumon credited both musicians that had left the band and had joined after the album was recorded. According to the sleeve of the album, though, the line-up consisted of Sumon as vocalist and bassist, Piklu as lead guitarist, Russell on the rhythm guitars and other vocal duties and Rumi as the drummer.

[[Trimatrik]] also started a trend of songs that would see "sequels" in later albums, including the ballad "Odbhut Shei Chheleti" and the taunt anthem "Guti".

===''Biborton'' (2001)===
Continuing with the same line-up that was confirmed as the band, [[Biborton]] would grow to be Aurthohin's most critically acclaimed and widely accepted album yet.{{cn|date=January 2014}} Featuring the sequels to the numbers "Odbhut Shei Chheleti" and "Guti", it also featured complex guitar and bass solos by the duo that was Piklu and Sumon and mixed in a blend of hard rock numbers intertwined with soft, melodious songs. Popular songs from the album include "Odbhut Shei Chheleti-2", which featured [[Artcell]] vocalist [[Linkon]] as a guest artist, as well as "Guti-2".

===''Notun Diner Michile'' (2002)===
Russell had left the band due to differences with frontman Sumon, paving the way for [[Kronic]] vocalist Imtiaz to fill in as guest vocalist for one of Aurthohin's most ambitious projects. Featuring the longest song in Bangladeshi rock history, "Shaat Din", it was released to huge expectations nationwide. The song, "Shaat Din", spanned 28 minutes and 31 seconds long, chronicling the last seven days of an inmate on death row. The album received mixed reviews, some praising the ambitiousness behind "Shaat Din" but feeling the other songs did not differentiate themselves from the pack.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

===''Dhrubok'' (2003)===
Imtiaz left the band, and the band collectively decided not to take any more guest members. Shishir of dNA joined the band as the new keyboardist and guitarist. The band then faced their biggest problem to date when vocalist Sumon got sick and doctors told him he would not be able to sing as he did before. Sumon had to stop singing most of the metal vocal arrangements, and the band decided to take a new vocalist. Rafa, the drummer of Severe Dementia joined the band as the vocalist and also a drummer. Aurthohin's fourth album, ''Dhrubok'' was released in 2003. Dhrubok went on to be one of the year's biggest hits and received overwhelming positive reviews.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

===Band problems (2005-2008)===
Shortly after Aurthohin's 4th album 'Dhrubok' got released Sumon's health deteriorated. Due to Sumon's illness the band stopped almost all the gigs. At the end of 2004 longtime guitarist Piklu left the band. Sumon got the affiliation from MTD (Michael Tobias Design). In 2005 Sumon's jaw got dislocated.Doctors told him to give up singing permanently. Chances of recovery were very low. Aurthohin stopped all their activities, Sumon and the others were planning to disband. But suddenly things began to change as Sumon was getting well. Aurthohin performed with the same line up until 2006. Kamal of Warfaze joined as a guest guitarist. After doing a few gigs Sumon offered him a permanent place which he accepted. Soon after the band started working on their fifth album.

===''Aushomapto 1'' (2008)===
After a long break of five years the band releases its 5th album by the name ''[[Aushomapto 1]]''. With this album the band completes THE GUTI songs series. It was a series of four heavy metal songs and the last song 'Guti (The Finale)' was a huge success. In this album there is also a sequel of another song from the album ''Dhrubok'' & the song's name is 'Chaite Paro'. The another hit song of this album was 'Chaite Paro-2'. Overall the album ''Aushomapto-1'' was one of the hit albums of the year 2008 and the band won Best-Band Award in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=131975|title=Rocking in the spirit of independence|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=2012-11-24|date=2010-03-23}}</ref>

===''Aushomapto 2'' (2011)===
Aurthohin released their 6th studio album on the 25th of November 2011. It contains 11 original tracks including sequels to previous songs 'Shurjo-2', 'Nikkrishto-2', Golper Shuru ('Audbhut Shei Chheleti prequel') and 'Anmonay-2'. Due to illness Kamal couldn't participate in the whole album. He played in 3 songs. Most of the guitar solos are done by Shishir while Rafa also contributed guitar solos in 3 songs. "Uru Uru Mon' , "Anmone-2", " Nikkrishto-2", "Surjo-2"  and "Cancer" has been instant hit. All songs except "Uru Uru Mon" are written by Sumon and all tracks composed and produced by Aurthohin. While some criticism over 'Nikkristo-2 'for its abusive lyrics, Rafa has been acclaimed for his vocal work this time around and the album itself regarded as one of the best albums of 2011.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

===After ''Aushomapto'' (2011-present)===
Due to illness of Sumon, Aurthohin didn't play many concert's in 2012. After a long break they came back with live gigs in early 2013. In the middle of the 2013, Aurthohin announced on their Facebook page that Kamal is no more with the band. On 15th October 2013, they released their new single "Amjonota", that has lyrics about Bangladesh's current events, corruptions, political conflict and other issues.
