'''italki''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|t|ɔː|k|i}} is an [[educational technology]] website that helps [[foreign language]] learners connect with online teachers and native-speaking language partners.  italki users are able to search for a freelance teacher, schedule and pay for language lessons.  italki teachers are able to create a profile, and build a personal reputation.

==Concept==
italki is an [[online marketplace]] and a [[social network]] focused on [[language learning]].  Users are classified as "students" or "teachers".  Membership on italki requires an email address, but payment is required to schedule lessons with online teachers.  Teachers go through an application process that includes verification of their identity and teaching credentials.

===Teacher Marketplace===
Paying users on italki are able to take lessons from freelance online teachers.  Teachers on italki are designated as "professional teachers" or "community tutors", the former having professional teaching experience or certifications.  Both types of teachers are able to create a teacher profile, and set their own rates for payment.<ref>"italki.com brings language teaching to market," Ryan McLaughlin, CNet Asia, http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/thetechdynasty/post.htm?id=63009740, March 24, 2009</ref>

When teachers conclude lessons, they receive feedback and ratings from italki students.<ref>"italki launches marketplace for language tutors," Camille Ricketts, VentureBeat, http://venturebeat.com/2009/03/25/italki-launches-marketplace-for-language-tutors/, March 25th, 2009</ref><br /> Most lessons take place on [[Skype]].  italki charges a 15% service fee for successful lesson transactions.

===Social Language Learning===
italki users are able to make friends for [[language exchange]], ask questions about language learning, write essays and receive corrections, and enter into language discussions.  These features depend on responses from other members of the italki community.

==History==
italki was founded by Kevin Chen and Yongyue Jiang in 2007, and officially registered in [[Hong Kong]], with a development center in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].<ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/italki italki | CrunchBase Profile]</ref>

In February 2016, italki relaunched its website with a new logo and design.  In the same month, italki also launched its [[Android (operating system)|Android]] native application.
