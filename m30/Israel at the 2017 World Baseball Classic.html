===Player eligibility===
Under WBC rules, any player eligible for citizenship of a country, even if they do not have it, may play for that team.<ref>http://deadspin.com/5167239/dan-serafini-wins-one-for-team-italy</ref> Therefore, this entitles Israel to have non-Israeli citizens of [[Jewish]] heritage play for the team. Based on the [[Law of Return]] anyone with one Jewish grandparent or people married to a Jew, is eligible for citizenship.<ref name="jpost">{{cite news |last=Omer-Man|first=Michael|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-in-History-Jewish-right-to-aliya-becomes-law|title= This Week in History: Jewish right to aliya becomes law|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref>

Before the 2013 tournament, a number of Major League players of Jewish descent, including [[Ian Kinsler]] and [[Kevin Youkilis]], publicly expressed interest in playing for Israel in the World Baseball Classic.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ben |first=Daniel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/sports/baseball-jewish-mlb-stars-could-play-for-israel-1.370536 |title=Baseball / Jewish MLB stars could play for Israel |work=Haaretz |date=May 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Neistat |first=Aimee |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/baseball-world-classic-youkilis-says-he-will-play-for-israel-if-it-qualifies-for-tournament-1.460430 |author= |title=Baseball / World Classic / Youkilis says he will play for Israel, if it qualifies for tournament |work=Haaretz |date=August 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref>  However, while some of the qualifying rounds were played after the conclusion of the 2012 season and included Major League players, Israel's qualifier was played in September 2012, during the Major League season.  Without its Major League players, Israel narrowly lost its qualifier to Spain (which had no Major League players at the time and thus was not affected by the scheduling). 

Israel was put into the same position during the qualifiers for the 2017 tournament.  Three of the four qualifiers took place during 2016 spring training and included Major League players.  However, Israel's qualifier is scheduled for September 2016.
