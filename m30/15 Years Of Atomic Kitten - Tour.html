'''15 Years Of Atomic Kitten''' is the upcoming concert tour by UK Girlgroup [[Atomic Kitten]].
They announced the Tour in late 2014, revealing shows in [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], while stating that Shows in [[Switzerland]], [[Australia]], [[Asia]], [[Russia]] and [[New Zealand]] and other countries are planned and scheduled (according to their official website) <ref>http://www.atomickitten.com/tour-2015/</ref> -
They also stated, that they are working on a new album for 2015. The group will perform in its second line-up, having [[Natasha Hamilton]], [[Liz McClarnon]] and [[Kerry Katona]], though [[Jenny Frost]] who was a member in the long run of their career (2001-2005) is not included, cause of personal things.

==Background==
First, after they split in 2005, they had sporadic appearances in 2006 (With the Football 2006 World Cup Theme Song "All Together Now", which was released in German speaking areas only) and 2008 (With Their Song "Anyone Who Had A Heart", which was featured on the #1-Liverpool album), they first were part of the TV show "[[The Big Reunion]]" where they performed after more than 7 years together in 2013 and 2014. They also announced their official reunion at the same time.
They also said that group member [[Jenny Frost]] is replaced by earlier member [[Kerry Katona]]. 
On December 4, 2014, VIP and standart pre-sale began on their official website.

The Band itself is very excited about the Tour: ''“We can’t wait for next year’s tour and we’ve got a fantastic album lined up as well. We’ve all grown up so much since our last Atomic Kitten tour, and so have our fans. There’ll be nostalgia, lots of fun and we’ll be bringing a whole new element to the shows that our fans can relate to. We want it to be one big celebration”''.
They also stated the tour will be supported by a new Atomic Kitten Album, scheduled for 2015.

The reason for the tour is the 15 year anniversary since their debut hit Single [[Whole Again]] from their Debut Album "[[Right Now (Atomic Kitten album)|Right Now]] which appeared in late 2000. The Band consisted of the nowadays line-Up. However, shortly thereafter, [[Kerry Katona]] left the Band, was replaced by [[Jenny Frost]] and the Album was re-released and the success of the band begun. They sold over 10 million records within the 5 years of their existence, till they split up in 2005. With hits Like Whole Again, the [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] cover [[The Tide Is High]], or [[If You Come To Me]], as well as [[Ladies Night (Atomic Kitten song)|Ladies Night]] or [[the Bangles]] cover [[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]], they beat the success of the [[Spice Girls]] according to a lot of online sites.<ref>http://www.antennebrandenburg.de/service/veranstaltungen/praesentationen/praesentationen/praesentationen2015/atom-kitten.html</ref> Their debut Song Whole Again overthorwned the success of [[Wannabe (Spice Girls song)|Wannabe]].
After the split in 2005 and the release of "[[Someone Like Me]]" as their farewell single, there was no more music made, except two sporadic chart appearances in 2006 and 2008. 
After Atomic Kitten was part of The arena tour TV show [[The Big Reunion]], they announced their reformucation with its former line-up, however without [[Jenny Frost]].
