She graduated from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] with a degree in [[psychology]] and a minor in [[economics]].<ref name="qa1"></ref>

==Career==
Hanna began her career on the [[Social networking service|social networking]] platform [[Vine (service)|Vine]] after graduating from college whilst working as a waitress. She claims her [[pseudonym]] "The Gabbie Show", obtained at a young age, was a nickname given when she was being "obnoxious". She later began to film herself in front of a mirror now portrayed as "The Gabbie Show".<ref name="qa1" /> Shortly after moving to [[Los Angeles]], fellow Vine personality Jessie Smiles taught her how to use the service. She also claims to have started using Vine after comedian [[Bo Burnham]] shared one of his Vines on his [[Twitter]] account.<ref name="lauren">{{cite web|last1=Francesca|first1=Lauren|title=Comedians Who have Inspired  Vine Stars|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttQGGuQlHiA|website=YouTube|accessdate=30 December 2016|date=23 October 2014}}</ref> Starting on Vine, she collaborated with many of its popular creators within the network such as David Dobrik, Alex James, and Jessie Smiles. Shortly after her rise to fame on Vine, she began a YouTube channel titled "The Gabbie Show", contributing of anecdotes about her personal life and the events that happen within it ("story times"). In one of Gabbie's story time videos she spoke about briefly dating a television actor whom she didn't name, Gabbie's fans rumoured the actor to be [[Desmond Harrington]] and in a later video Gabbie confirmed this. She has collaborated with some of the more renown YouTube personalities in the past, such as [[Lilly Singh]], [[Liza Koshy]], David Dobrik, [[Joey Graceffa]], [[D-trix|D-Trix]], [[Ricky Dillon]], [[Grace Helbig]], [[Jason Nash]], [[Shane Dawson]] and [[Colleen Ballinger]] (whom also portrays herself as a fictitious character named [[Miranda Sings]]).

In 2015, as an advocate for youth smoking prevention, Hanna participated in a 100-stop tour for [[Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)|Truth]],<ref name="vcstar.com" /> a national campaign aimed at curbing youth smoking in the United States.

On November 30, 2016, Hanna began a twenty-city lip sync battle-themed tour called "Drop the Mic", which was hosted by [[Chachi Gonzales]] and featured [[Jack Baran]], [[Ricky Dillon]], and Andrew Lowe.<ref name="tubefilter">{{cite web |url= http://www.tubefilter.com/2016/10/25/fullscreen-drop-the-mic-tour/ |title= Fullscreen Launches New Live Tour, Bringing YouTube Stars To A Lip Sync Battle |last= Gutelle |first= Sam |date= October 25, 2016 |website= Tubefilter.com |publisher= Tubefilter, Inc. |location= Los Angeles, California |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date= December 8, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fullscreenlive.com/events/drop-the-mic-2016/|title=Drop The Mic: 2016|website=Fullscreen Live|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref>
