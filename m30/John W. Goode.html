'''John William Goode, Jr.''' (March 10, 1923 &ndash; February 5, 1994), was a [[lawyer]] in his native [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]],  who was a figure in the 1950s and 1960s rebirth of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in [[Texas]].

==Background==

Goode was a son of the physician John Goode, Sr. (1886-1959), and the former Claudia Alice Nolte (1895-1969). In 1939, shortly after his sixteenth birthday, he graduated from [[Thomas Jefferson High School (San Antonio, Texas)|Jefferson High School]]. He attended [[Washington and Lee University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]] for three years from 1939 to 1942,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spoke.com/people/john-goode-3e1429c09e597c100387d911|title=John Goode|publisher=spoke.com|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> but he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1943 from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] in the capital city of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=alcalde>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=John+W.+Goode+of+San+Antonio,+TX&source=bl&ots=ixgF_SYQzW&sig=QAdCbZO5LSU1pd0K5JeF4W-Huc8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiTkfSlrODMAhUK6YMKHVr1AM44ChDoAQg6MAY#v=onepage&q=John%20W.%20Goode%20of%20San%20Antonio%2C%20TX&f=false|title=''The Alcalde''|page=37|date=May 1994|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Military==

During [[World War II]], Goode served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a combat infantry [[platoon]] leader and executive officer in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]] battles of [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]], [[Battle of New Britain|New Britain]], [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]], and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]]. In the two latter battles, he was wounded. He was [[Military discharge|honorably discharged]] in 1945 at the rank of [[captain]].<ref name=obit/> At Peleliu, as a [[second lieutenant]], he received the [[Silver Star]] for courageous actions on September 27, 1944. When his platoon encountered the [[Japan]]ese on a hill, Goode brought forward a [[machine-gun]] section. He pushed through hostile machine-gun and rifle fire which had already caused the death of one of his men and the wounding of two others. Twenty enemy soldiers were killed. Later in the day, Goode again braved hostile fire but managed to return to his support squad. His calm under hostile action and leadership in battle were determined to have saved the lives of many of his men. His superiors concluded that Goode's "gallant devotion to duty reflects great credit on [him] and the United States Naval Service."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=36549|title=John W. Goode, Jr.: Silver Star|publisher=''Military Times''|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Goode also received the [[Bronze Star]] and a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]].<ref name=obit>"John W. Goode Jr.: Goode involved in law, politics: Active in legal and political ventures more than 40 years, but he was best known for his campaign against U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez in a special election in 1961", ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', February 6, 1994</ref>

==Family==

In 1949, Goode married the former Janet Irwin, who died prior to 2003. The couple's two sons were John, III, and George Irwin Goode, who predeceased his father. Goode, III, known as "Grizzly" or "Johnny", was an artist and graphic designer who worked in the restaurant and nightclub business in San Antonio and was a state judo champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://porterloring.tributes.com/obituary/show/John-Grizzly-Goode-102527030|title=John "Grizzly" Goode|publisher=Porter Loring Tributes|date=May 16, 2003|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

Goode's sister, Eleanor Goode Brune (1927-2005), was from 1950 to 1956, the national committeewoman of the Young Republican Federation of Texas. Like her brother, she was a UT graduate. She also attended the Worden School of Social Work at [[Our Lady of the Lake University]] in San Antonio and was active in social work programs, having organized the Volunteer Service Bureau and worked with [[Visual impairment|blind]] children. She retired to the [[rural]] but historic [[Crowell, Texas|Crowell]] community in [[Foard County, Texas|Foard County]] in [[West Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/obituary.aspx?n=eleanor-goode-brune&pid=15699782#sthash.KpQF06Oh.dpuf|title=Eleanor Goode Brune|publisher=''[[Dallas Morning News]]''|date=November 20, 2005|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Eleanor's husband and Goode's brother-in-law, David H. Brune (1930-2007), a native of [[California]], was in legal partnership with Goode from 1958 to 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/obituary.aspx?n=david-h-brune&pid=85954524|title=David Brune|publisher=''Dallas Morning News''|date=January 14, 2007|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Law and politics==

After the war, Goode completed his studies in 1948 at the [[University of Texas School of Law]].<ref name=alcalde/> For two-and-a-half years, he was acting first assistant DA in the office of the [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]] [[District Attorney]]. He entered private practice thereafter and was involved during the course of his legal career in several firms, beginning with Hardy & Goode and ending with Goode, Casseb & Jones, now Goode, Casseb, Jones, Riklin, Choate & Watson. "He was so devoted to his law practice that, it was his hobby. ... He enjoyed corporate law and not the glamorous criminal law as much, although he did do some criminal cases," recalled his son, John W. Goode, III (1949-2003).<ref name=obit/> 

Goode worked in the successful [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] campaign in [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952]]. He was a chairman of the San Antonio Municipal Civil Service Commission, and he was a Republican county chairman.<ref name=obit/> He was a delegate to the [[1960 Republican National Convention]] held in [[Chicago]] to nominate the unsuccessful [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]]-[[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Lodge]] [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/goode.html|title=Goode, John W., Jr.|publisher=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref>  In November 1961, he was the Republican candidate in a [[special election]] for the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[Texas' 20th congressional district]] but was defeated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Henry B. Gonzalez]], the first [[Hispanic]] to serve in both the [[Texas State Senate]] and as a member of Congress from Texas.<ref name=obit/> Goode had been hopeful of a political upset after former President Eisenhower flew to San Antonio, where he had been stationed in the military years earlier, to campaign with Goode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utsa/00306/00306-P.html|title=Eisenhower, Dwight D.: visit to San Antonio in behalf of John Goode and Henry Catto, Jr.; downtown San Antonio|publisher=University of Texas Library|date=October 29, 1961|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> The candidate also received support from a [[Conservative Democrat]]ic group.<ref>"Conservative Demos go for Goode", ''San Antonio Express and News'', October 29, 1961, p. 5.</ref>because Gonzalez had lost out in another special election in May of that year for the [[United States Senate]] seat formerly held by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], then the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. Victory in that race had ultimately gone in a major upset to [[John Tower]], the first Republican to represent Texas in the upper legislative chamber in the 20th century.

In November 1993, three months before his death, Goode was inducted into the Bexar County Republican Party's newly-established Hall of Fame. Goode was active in  several civic organizations and fraternities, including the Texas Cavaliers, Texas Law Foundation, the San Antonio Bar Association, and the Order of the Alamo.<ref name=obit/>

Goode died in San Antonio a month prior to his 71st birthday. A memorial service was held at the [[Episcopal  Church in the United States|Episcopalian]] Church of Reconciliation in San Antonio. He was [[Cremation|cremated]].<ref name=obit/>
