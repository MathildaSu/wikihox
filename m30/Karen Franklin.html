==Career==

Franklin earned her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in journalism from [[San Francisco State University]] in 1982, and worked as a daily newspaper journalist and a criminal investigator before entering the field of psychology. She earned her [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[clinical psychology]] from the [[California School of Professional Psychology]] in [[Alameda, California]], with  a fellowship to fund her dissertation on the topic of [[Homophobia|antigay]] behaviors by young adults<ref name=franklin2000>Franklin, K. (2000). "[http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/15/4/339.short Antigay Behaviors by Young Adults: Prevalence, Patterns and Motivators in a Noncriminal Population]". ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence,'' Vol. 15 No. 4</ref> from the [[Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation]]. She went on to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship in [[forensic psychology]] through the [[University of Washington]].

After working in Washington at a state prison and a mental hospital, she returned to California and started a private forensic psychology practice specializing in the evaluation of criminal and juvenile offenders.

She teaches [[forensic psychology]] courses at [[Alliant International University]] and taught a course on [[sexual violence]] in the Sexuality Studies Program at [[San Francisco State University]]. Her opinion on the [[kidnapping of Jaycee Lee Dugard]] has appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>Franklin, K. (2009, Aug. 29). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/aug/28/jaycee-lee-dugard-kidnap-phillip-garrido Jaycee Dugard, transfixed by a monster], Guardian of UK</ref> She also hosts the forensic psychology news blog ''In the News'',<ref name=blogspot/> and another one on ''[[Psychology Today]]'' called ''Witness''.<ref name=witness/>

==Research==

===Hate crimes research===

During the 1990s, a [[hate crime]]s lobby in the [[United States]] resulted in the passage of federal and state laws that increased punishment for crimes in which bias played a role. Much of the extant research on hate crimes relied on victim accounts of perpetrators and their motivations. Franklin's finding in 2008 indicates that many assailants held little animosity toward homosexuals and challenged the dominant notions of hate crime motivations. "Although the term hate crime conjures up images of [[swastikas]], burning crosses, bigoted [[zealots]], and a [[right-wing]] fringe far removed from America’s more socially tolerant center, …  so-called ‘[[gay-bashing]]s’ by young males suggests that it is a type of transient offense committed primarily as a result of environmental rather than internal psychological factors."<ref>Franklin, K. and Herek, G. (2008) "Sexual minorities, violence against," Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict, 2nd Edition, Oxford: Elsevier</ref>

Upon publication in 1998,{{where|date=March 2013}} Franklin's study received mentions in the  media, including in ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref name=Brooke>Brooke, James (1998, October 14), "[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/14/us/homophobia-often-found-in-schools-data-show.html Homophobia Often Found In Schools, Data Show]," New York Times, Page A-19</ref> the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',<ref name=boxall>Bettina Boxall and Duane Noriyuki (1999, May 28), "[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/28/news/mn-41998 Abuse of gay students brings increase in lawsuits]", Los Angeles Times.</ref> and the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]].<ref name=smith>Smith, Carol (1998, August 20, "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64598021.html Study finds extensive anti-gay behavior. (News)]", Seattle Post-Intelligencer.</ref> Her research was later covered in a 2000 PBS ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary, "[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/ Assault on Gay America]", in which she was also interviewed.<ref name=pbs>Public Broadcasting Service (February 15, 2000), [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/ Assault on Gay America]; [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/etc/script.html transcript]</ref> She was awarded the 2012 Distinguished Scientific Achievement In Psychology award from the California Psychological Association (CPA), for her research on hate crimes, multiple-perpetrator rape and ethics of psychiatric diagnosis in forensic settings.<ref name="cpapsych.org">{{cite web|title=2012 CPA Awards|publisher=California Psychological Association|date=May–June 2012|accessdate=May 3, 2012|url=http://www.karenfranklin.com/files/CPA-Award-2012.pdf}}</ref>

===Theory of multiple-offender rape===
In 2004, she proposed that group rape of women and violence against homosexuals were "parallel forms of cultural theater, with the victims serving as interchangeable dramatic props." <ref>Franklin, K. (2004) [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1525%2Fsrsp.2004.1.2.25 "Enacting Masculinity: Antigay Violence and Group Rape as Participatory Theater]." Sexuality Research & Social Policy. Vol. 1 No. 2, pp. 25-40</ref> She argued that the social functions of both types of group violence included social bonding, the celebration of power, and the public display of heterosexual masculinity.

=== Diagnosis ===
Franklin has written that clinical diagnoses are used to express biases of the clinician: "Masking its implicit bias beneath a veneer of scientific objectivity, in adversarial settings [a diagnosis of] [[psychopathy]] can literally be the kiss of death."<ref>http://www.npr.org/2011/05/26/136433233/expert-panel-weighing-the-value-of-a-test-for-psychopaths </ref>  

She wrote that [[hebephilia]] (the sexual preference for pubescent children, usually ages 11-14) should not be considered as a mental disorder, arguing that "large proportions of heterosexual men are sexually attracted to young pubescent girls" and therefore such attraction was natural.  She claimed that hebephilia was solely the invention of a single agency, the Canadian [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH).<ref name=Franklin2010>{{Cite journal|title=Hebephilia: quintessence of diagnostic pretextuality|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21110392|year=2010|author=Franklin, K.|journal = Behav Sci Law|pages=751–68|volume=28|issue=6|pmid=21110392|doi=10.1002/bsl.934|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> 

In ''The Errors of Karen Franklin's Pretextuality,'' published in the same journal, [[paraphilia]] expert [[James Cantor]] responded, “Franklin’s claims that hebephilia is not widely recognized—or not widely investigated, or not widely cited—are simply a series of easily revealed falsehoods about the state of the peer-reviewed literature.” He provided lists of counter-evidence to Franklin’s assertions, saying her article was “A series of easily falsified mischaracterizations of the content and status of the science of hebephilia, a series of vague insinuations unrelated to the findings, and a misrepresentation of the operation of the masked peer review system, serving to evoke rhetorical sympathy from any readers unaware of how such systems operate”.<ref>{{cite pmid | 22745581}}</ref>  According to the journal’s editor, Franklin was invited to submit a rebuttal, but declined.

One of Franklin's arguments against hebephilia was that attraction to pubescent children would be evolutionarily advantageous. CAMH sexologist [[Ray Blanchard]] responded that Franklin's "adaptationist argument" would apply only to heterosexual males (as homosexual hebephilia would have no reproductive advantages).  Blanchard went on to provide evidence showing the opposite of what Franklin's theory would predict: hebephiles actually produce fewer offspring than individuals with a sexual preference for adults, thus indicating the condition did not have a reproductive advantage.<ref>{{cite pmid |20848175 }}</ref>
