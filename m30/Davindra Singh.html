'''Davindra Singh''' (born 14 October 1969) is a Toronto based dermatologist specializing in ethnic skincare and is the developer of the Rapid Access Clinic (RAC).

== Medical experience ==
Singh's career has taken him through three different specialities of medicine; [[family medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], and [[dermatology]].
After Singh finished his undergraduate studies and medical school at [[Queen's University]] he completed a Family Medicine residency at [[McMaster University]]. Four years after this residency, Singh became a Board-certified emergency physician. Another four years later, Singh began a residency in dermatology at the [[University of Toronto]] and completed this in 2007.
Singh also spent many months travelling internationally to various facilities to develop his knowledge of ethnic skin care; these travels included a mini-fellowship at [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Singh also holds academic appointments at several institutions, including Queen's University, the University of Toronto, [[Laurentian University]], and [[Lakehead University]] and speaks frequently at medical events across North America.

== Dermatology ==
Following the completion of his dermatology residency, Singh practiced dermatology in his hometown of [[Peterborough, Ontario]], an extremely underserviced area. Whilst there, he reduced the waiting time from 9 months to less than 2 months due to his diligent work ethic. He maintained an academic practice at [[Women's College Hospital]], allowing him to teach and learn from the residents of a very well known academic centre.  He was the recipient of the Young Clinician Educator award in 2009.

In 2010 Singh opened his own clinic, AvantDerm. AvantDerm offers a Rapid Access Clinic (RAC), which functions like a walk-in clinic; the RAC drastically reduces wait times and improves access for patients needing to see a dermatologist. In addition, he has brought cutting edge technology and skill to the area in order to look after the special needs of the ethnic skin population. Despite the fact that the [[United Nations]] has declared Toronto to be the most ethnically diverse city in the world, Singh recognized that this population was not being well-served; he gained advanced knowledge in this area by doing a self-directed fellowship to become an expert in this area of dermatology. Singh's goal is to bring the level of care in Toronto up to the standards experienced elsewhere at well-respected ethnic skin centres around the world.

Singh remains committed to the Northern Ontario areas where he practiced family medicine and emergency medicine. As such he continues to travel to [[Timmins]] to act as the only visiting dermatologist for the entire district and catchment area. He also provides consultations to underserviced areas and patients via telemedicine.

== Sikh Centennial Foundation ==
Singh has held the position of Chair of the Sikh Centennial Foundation's gala committee for 2 years in a row and was able to spearhead fundraising efforts and raise over $300,000 during this time. The Gala is the highlight of the year for the community and is an opportunity to showcase the history, culture, and achievements of exemplary individuals. He now serves on the Board of Directors for this Foundation.
