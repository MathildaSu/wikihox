'''Rob McEwen''', [[Order of Canada|CC]] (born April 15, 1950) is a Canadian businessman. He is the chairman and CEO of McEwen Mining Inc., Chairman of [[Lexam VG Gold]] Inc. and was the founder and former chairman and CEO of [[Goldcorp]] Inc., which is the worldâ€™s largest gold producer based on market capitalization. McEwen followed his father into the investment industry and also developed a passion for gold.

In 1990 McEwen stepped into the mining industry, where he transformed Goldcorp from a collection of small companies into a mining powerhouse. Since 1993, when McEwen started re-structuring Goldcorp, its market capitalization has grown from $50 million [[USD]] to over $20 billion and Goldcorp's share price has increased at a 31% compound annual growth rate.

There was a scenario in which he was undecided where to mine the gold. In the end, he used the internet to post all the data on the mine, and invite scientists all over the world to take the challenge of helping Goldcorp find its next successful 6 million ounces of gold. His colleagues were horrified that he wanted to share the company's proprietary data with the world. But response was overwhelming and many qualified participants submitted detailed drilling plans to the company.<ref>[http://dailytools.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/mavericks-at-work/ Rob McEwen's gold mining effort "Mavericks at Work"], "Daily Tools" Black Book (blog), 17 November 2014</ref>

Rob believes that management should be as personally invested in a company as its shareholders, and as such, he owns 25% of the outstanding shares of McEwen Mining Inc. and 27% of Lexam VG Gold Inc.'s. Rob receives no salary.

A graduate of [[St. Andrew's College (Aurora, Ontario)|St. Andrew's College]], Aurora, Ontario, Canada in 1969 [http://www.sac.on.ca/files/ksillcox/andrean_2007_fall_lr.pdf], McEwen later earned a B.A. from the [[University of Western Ontario]], London, Ontario, Canada and an [[MBA]] from the [[Schulich School of Business]].
Rob also holds an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from [[York University]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada.<ref> Corporate website: http://mcewenmining.com/Management/CEO/default.aspx</ref>

McEwen is a member of WPO, the Canadian Council of Chief Executives and the Dean's Advisory Board, [[Schulich School of Business]], Toronto.
