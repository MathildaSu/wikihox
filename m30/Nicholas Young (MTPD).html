'''Nicholas Young''', 36, of Fairfax, is alleged to have tried to assist ISIS while working for the Metro Transit Police Department in Washington, D.C.

Although prosecutors say that the [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|Metro]] system which provides rail and bus services to more than 672,000 residents in the District of Columbia was never jeopardized; the agency administrator's Chief of Police allowed Nicholas Young to be employed as a Metro Transit Police officer<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pix11.com/2016/08/03/dc-transit-officer-charged-with-aiding-isis-sources/|title=DC transit officer charged with aiding ISIS: sources|date=2016-08-03|website=New York's PIX11 / WPIX-TV|access-date=2016-08-31}}</ref> in the jurisdictions of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

Many on Capitol Hill questioned whether Young's position as an Armed [[Metro Transit Police Department|Metro Transit Police Department Officer]] with Arrest Powers would have left the Metro Subway System safer or since the Metro system opens from 5 am and closes about 12 pm and so Officer Nicholas Young was in one 6 am to 4 pm, or either the 2 pm to 12 pm or 10 pm to 8 am divided shift by the Metro Transit Police.

In 2016, Young bought $250 in gift cards to have terrorists communicate more securely and was arrested by an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent, according to a court affidavit,<ref>https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/virginia-man-arrested-attempting-support-isil</ref> and [[Federal government of the United States|the Federal Government]] and the [[United States Department of Justice]] charged the first American Police officer with aiding and providing material support to a terrorist organization.

[[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia]] will press charges by the MTPD for Official Police Misconduct.
