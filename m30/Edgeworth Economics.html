'''Edgeworth Economics''' LLC (Edgeworth)<ref>http://www.edgewortheconomics.com/about-us/</ref> is an economic consulting firm that provides consulting services to law firms and Fortune 500 companies. Edgeworth economists work with clients to manage complex litigations involving [[antitrust]], [[mergers and acquisitions]], China, [[class certification]], [[employment law]], [[intellectual property]], complex commercial damages, and [[data management]].

The company was named after the economist [[Francis Edgeworth]], whose most recognized contribution to the field of economics was his initial insight into the notion of “Pareto optimality”—where a transaction makes an individual better off without making anyone else worse off. This concept is one of the guiding principles of Edgeworth Economics, where employees work to develop internal talent to both make each individual more successful and make clients better off.

Edgeworth was founded in 2009 by economists Dr. John H. Johnson IV, Dr. Jesse David and Matt Milner. Dr. John H. Johnson IV serves as the president and CEO of Edgeworth.
