The '''Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"''' is a trans- and interdisciplinary network of researchers at [[Heidelberg University]]. It was started in October 2007, and extended in 2012, as part of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Excellence Initiative]] launched by the German state and its federal governments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zweite Runde in der Exzellenzinitiative entschieden|url=http://www.dfg.de/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/2007/pressemitteilung_nr_65/index.html|website=Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Entscheidungen in der zweiten Programmphase der Exzellenzinitiative|url=http://www.dfg.de/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/2012/pressemitteilung_nr_26/index.html|website=Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> The researchers examine the processes of exchange between the cultures, ranging from migration and trade to the formation of concepts and institutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Am 20. Oktober wird das Heidelberger Exzellenzcluster "Asien und Europa" feierlich eröffnet|url=http://idw-online.de/de/news282927|website=idw-Informationsdienst Wissenschaft|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>

== Overview ==
The Cluster aims to enhance the understanding of the multi-layered interactions between and within Asia and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aims and Objectives|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/about-us/aims-and-objectives.html|website=Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> In the first funding period from 2008 to 2012, the scholars analysed the shifting asymmetries in cultural, social and political flows. Built on this foundation, the researchers explore in the second funding period until 2017, in which dynamics the transcultural processes between and within Asia and Europe develop.

The Cluster is located at the Karl Jaspers Centre for Advanced Transcultural Studies (KJC) at [[Heidelberg University]], Germany. The KJC provides facilities and infrastructure for collaboration, research and teaching.<ref>{{cite web|title=Current Clusters of Excellence|url=http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/list/projectdetails/index.jsp?id=39092596|website=Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> A branch office of the Cluster is located at the “Heidelberg Center South Asia” in [[New Delhi]], [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Universität Heidelberg Opens Heidelberg Center South Asia in New Delhi|url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news09/pm20091111_hcsa_en.html|website=Heidelberg Universität|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>

The Cluster is headed by a directorate consisting of Joseph Maran (Pre- and Protohistory), [[Axel Michaels]] (Classical Indology) and [[Barbara Mittler]] (Sinology).<ref>{{cite web|title=Directoriate|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/about-us/organisation-and-management/directorate.html|website=Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>

== Research ==
The research projects are organised in four research areas: “Governance & Administration”, “Public Spheres”, “Knowledge Systems” and “Historicities & Heritage”.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research.html|website=Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> Five professorships in Buddhist Studies, Cultural Economic History, Global Art History, Intellectual History, Visual and Media Anthropology as well as two Start-Up Professorships for Transcultural Studies and Junior Research Groups headed by post-doctoral scholars are located at the Cluster.<ref>{{cite web|title=HCTS Professorships / Permanent Fellows|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/hcts-professorships.html|website=Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>

The “[[Heidelberg Research Architecture]]” develops metadata frameworks. It forms a digital humanities environment for researchers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Heidelberg Research Architecture|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/hra-portal.html|website=Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>

Research results are published in international journals and book series. The Cluster has launched two book series -“Transcultural Research: Heidelberg Studies on Asia and Europe in a Global Context”<ref>{{cite web|title=Transcultural Research – Heidelberg Studies on Asia and Europe in a Global Context|url=http://www.springer.com/series/8753|website=Springer|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> and “Heidelberg Transcultural Studies” – as well as the e-journal “Transcultural Studies”.<ref>{{cite web|title=E-Journal on "Transcultural Studies"|url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news2010/pm20101214_transkulturelle_studien_en.html|website=Heidelberg University|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> All of them are peer-reviewed.

== Teaching ==
The M.A. Transcultural Studies started in the winter term 2011/12 at Heidelberg University and combines interdisciplinary education with a transcultural focus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Der neue Master-Studiengang "Transcultural Studies"|url=http://147.142.222.80:8081/Plone/SHAN/newsletter/2011/shan-newsletter-november-nr.-57/der-neue-master-studiengang-201etranscultural-studies201c|website=SHAN e.V.|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> Language of instruction in English.<ref>{{cite web|title=M.A. Transcultural Studies|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/studies/ma-transcultural-studies.html|website=Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>

The Graduate Programme for Transcultural Studies (GPTS) offers a structured doctoral programme within the interdisciplinary research environment of the Cluster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Graduate Programme for Transcultural Studies|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/studies/graduate-programme-for-transcultural-studies.html|website=Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>
