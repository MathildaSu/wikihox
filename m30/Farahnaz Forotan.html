With the fall of the Mujahidden regime and the rise of the [[Taliban]], her [[family]] like [[millions]] of other Afghan [[households]], fled the uproar of rockets and instability of [[Afghanistan]] to the [[neighboring]] country, [[Iran]]

== Early life ==

Like endless other Afghan families, Farahnaz's [[family]] also paid an [[extraordinary]] price for their [[immigration]], including a lack of education in [[Iran]]. Due to their immigrant or [[refugee]] status, Farahnaz's and her sisters, along with other Afghans residing in Iran, were denied an [[education]] by the [[Iranian]] authorities: and obvious violation of the education policy of the [[United Nations]]. Fortunate for her, she was able to continue school from grades one through four, in a private Afghan [[School]] called "
Sayyed Jamaluddin Afghan". A school with very limited [[funding]], staff, or facilities.

== After the fall of Taliban ==

In 2001, the creation of a temporary government, followed by the country's first democratic election in thirty years, and during former president Hamid Karzai's first term of presisdency, Farahnaz's family returned to Afghanistan.

Farahnaz was only grade eight when she begun working with a private [[television]] in the Afghan capital "Norren TV" from that very young age, she was [[passionate]] about working with and for the media. She continued working for the same station for two [[consecutive]] years.<ref>[https://twitter.com/fforotan .] Farahnaz Reports on Twitter.</ref>

Her journet was then followed by the second most talked-about [[commercial]] [[television]] [[station]] of the country, "Ariana Television Network." after working in Ariana's production department for a short term, she then moved on to investigative reporting and news. Within a very minimum amount of experience or exposure to the professional technicality of the job, but with her own hard-work and dedication, she soon became a household name among the country favorite [[journalists]]. She has traveled around the [[country]] and abroad to to [[correspond]] to [[Afghanistan]] related stories, unlike other Afghan female [[journalist]]. After the country's forty years of war, she is the first female journalist to have reported from Sangeen district of Helmand,<ref name=Sangeen >[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j27_fVu9ldY .] Report from Sangeen District by Farahnaz Forotan.</ref> one of the deadliest war-zones in the country and a nest to the Taliban.

Though she first rose to fame with an [[investigative]] [[documentary]] on the lives of Taliban prisoners.<ref name=Prisoners>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVu9mjxoJ3Q.] [[Taliban]] [[Documentary]].</ref> A [[documentary]] that dissected the thought-process, and their reasons behind targeting the Afghan and [[international]] forces, along with that of the general public in [[Afghanistan]]. As the prisoners [[assertively]] spoke about how each had gotten to their specified [[cells]], from the very first moments into being [[propagated]] towards the destruction of [[innocent]] lives, their lives in prison was observed in order to secure their [[human rights]], while in prison.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRqyrfVZnzY .] Zendan-Special Report by Farahnaz Frotan 26/2/2014 .</ref>

== Currently ==

[[Currently]] continuing her post secondary education as an international relations' student at a private university, Farahnaz has received numerous national awards. she was award '[[Journalist]] in the country by [[Afghanistan]]'s Free Media Association in 2015. She is the yougest female [[journalist]] in the [[country]] to have been a recipient of the [[highest]] [[national]] [[Afghan]] award from the [[Islamic]] [[Republic]] of [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Government]], at the age of twenty three.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
