==Career==
Arun Dravid has cultivated a balanced version of the “Bhava-dominant” style of Smt. [[Kishori Amonkar]] and the structural beauty that is the characteristic of the puritanical [[Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana]] gayaki. He is now recognized as an outstanding exponent of Jaipur-Atrauli gayaki in India and abroad. In her recent biography titled "Ganasaraswati" (page 61), Smt. [[Kishori Amonkar]] has specifically noted that Arunji is her only disciple who has preserved and continues to sing the pure [[Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana]] gayaki tradition.  Arun also sings with equal charm light-classical varieties such as [[Thumris]] and [[Natya-Sangeet]].

He is currently a Vice President of a large global engineering company named Jacobs Engineering Group in California (USA), and concurrently the Chairman of Jacobs Engineering India.
