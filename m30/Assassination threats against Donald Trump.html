==Assassination attempts==

===Thomas DiMassimo===
At a campaign rally at [[Dayton, Ohio]], Thomas DiMassimo attempted to rush the stage on which Trump was speaking.

===Michael Sandford===
Michael Sandford, a 20-year-old Briton from [[Dorking]] in [[Surrey]], was arrested on June 18, 2016, for attempting to kill Trump. He was a resident of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], for eighteen months before outstaying his visa and relocating to [[San Bernardino, California]], to practice shooting. Sandford bought tickets to Trump rallies in [[Las Vegas]] and in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; at the former, he was arrested for trying to steal a gun from a security guard. Sandford, who is autistic and had been treated for [[mental health]] issues in England, said that he had been preparing to kill Trump for over a year.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Payton|first1=Matt|title=Michael Sandford: Everything we know about the British man who 'tried to assassinate Donald Trump'|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-assassination-shoot-attempt-michael-sandford-gun-what-happened-everything-you-need-to-a7093476.html|accessdate=June 27, 2016|work=The Independent|date=June 21, 2016}}</ref> His parents said they believed that their son had been manipulated into plotting an attack due to his low social intelligence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump suspect Michael Sandford was a 'very quiet lad'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-36588461|accessdate=June 27, 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=June 21, 2016}}</ref> On June 29, Sandford was charged with disrupting an official function and two firearms counts.

==Assassination threats==

===Emadeldin Elsayed===
Emadeldin Elsayed, a 23-year-old Egyptian studying to become an airline pilot in California, was investigated by the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] in February 2016. Elsayed had made a threatening post against Trump on [[Facebook]], after Trump had declared that he would temporarily ban foreign Muslims from entering the U.S. He was reported to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] by the owner of his flight school, Alex Khatib, and taken into detention. After Khatib was advised to expel his student, Elsayed had his visa revoked and was given a voluntary departure, escorted by federal agents, instead of a formal deportation. Elsayed was not charged with a criminal offense, and his treatment was criticized by the local [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the Egyptian public as not in line with protection of free speech.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stack|first1=Liam|title=Egyptian Aviation Student Who Made Trump Threat Is Leaving U.S.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/us/egyptian-aviation-student-who-made-trump-threat-is-forced-to-leave-us.html?_r=0|accessdate=June 27, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2016}}</ref>

Radio host [[Glenn Beck]] was subjected to a federal investigation after reportedly threatening to stab Donald Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/03/04/glenn-beck-under-investigation-for-alleged-threat-against-trump/|title=Glenn Beck Under Investigation For Alleged Threat Against Trump|date=March 4, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=CBS Local}}</ref> During his [[Glenn Beck Radio Program|radio program]], Glenn Beck had said, "If I was close enough and I had a knife. Really. I mean the stabbing just wouldn't stop." The conversation was reported as a threat against Donald Trump. The program's producer, Stu Burguiere wrote a Facebook post stating that the threat in the conversation was actually targeted at him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/5/glenn-beck-under-investigation-for-alleged-threat-/|title=Glenn Beck under investigation for alleged threat against Donald Trump|work=The Washington Times|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref> Beck was later suspended from [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]] after a subsequent interview in which a guest made similar threats.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/31/media/glenn-beck-suspension-siriusxm/index.html|title=Glenn Beck suspended by SiriusXM|first=Tom|last=Kludt|date=May 31, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref>

===Two Georgia teens===
In late March 2016, Sheriff Chuck Smith of [[Meriwether County, Georgia]], said that a 15-year-old boy was arrested for making an alleged death threat against Trump on social media. That same week, a 16-year-old boy was also arrested for making similar threats. Because both boys were minors, neither their names nor the nature of their alleged threats were released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nypost.com/2016/03/26/two-teens-arrested-for-threatening-trump-on-social-media/|title=Two teens arrested for threatening Trump on social media|agency=Associated Press|date=March 26, 2016|publisher=The New York Post|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref>

===Brad Thor===
While appearing on the ''[[Glenn Beck Radio Program]]'', and on his Twitter account, thriller novelist [[Brad Thor]] asked, hypothetically as he later claimed, "what patriot will step up and [remove Trump from office]" should a Trump presidency become tyrannical. Thor then hinted at assassinating Trump. 

{{Quote|I guarantee you ... during his reign ... [Trump] is going to petition the American people to allow a temporary suspension of the Constitution ... [T]his could ring down incredible heat on me because I'm about to suggest something very bad ... With the feckless, spineless Congress we have, who will stand in the way of Donald Trump overstepping his constitutional authority as President? If Congress won't remove him from office, ''what patriot will step up'' and do that if ... he oversteps ... his constitutionally granted authority? ... [Y]ou won't be able to do it through Congress.|Brad Thor<ref name=Federalist.Apple>{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/06/02/brad-thor-is-right-death-to-tyrants-is-as-american-as-apple-pie/|title=Brad Thor Is Right: ‘Death To Tyrants’ Is As American As Apple Pie|work=The Federalist|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2016|first=Robert|last=Tracinski}}</ref>}}

Both Thor and Glenn Beck (who was later suspended from [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]] after the interview<ref name="auto"/>) denied that the commends were threats against Trump's life but were merely hypothetical statements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/05/31/brad-thor-glenn-beck-interview/|title=Brad Thor Changes Story About What He Meant in Glenn Beck Interview|first=Patrick|last=Howly|accessdate=August 10, 2016|date=May 31, 2016|work=Breitbart}}</ref> Susan Write of [[RedState]] and Robert Tracinski of ''[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]]'' wrote columns in support of Thor and Beck, Tracincki writing that "death to tyrants is as American as apple pie."<ref name=Federalist.Apple/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/31/stand-glenn-beck-brad-thor/|title=I Stand With Glenn Beck and Brad Thor|first=Susan|last=Wright|date=May 31, 2016|work=RedState|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref> ''RedState'' founder [[Erick Erickson]] and ''The Federalist'' editor Ben Domenech are both vocal critics of the Trump campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430126/donald-trump-conservatives-oppose-nomination|title=Conservatives against Trump|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The National Review}}</ref>
