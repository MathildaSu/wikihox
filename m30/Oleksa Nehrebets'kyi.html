==Biographical facts==
Oleksa Nehrebets’kyi is a graduate of the biological faculty in [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]], 1978. In 1998-2002 he studied at the Faculty of Philology in Taras Shevchenko National University of [[Kyiv]]. From 1994 till now he is working as a writer and freelance translator.
By his efforts such famous films as ''Alf'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', the animated series ''Pug Tomas and His Friends'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', the animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''Open Season'', ''Flushed Away'', ''The Adventures of Despereaux'' and ''[[Happy Feet]]'' were translated into Ukrainian. He collaborated with editing books of Joan Rowling’s [[Harry Potter]] series. In 2002-2003 he worked as a screenwriter of radio series called "The Life in distance of ten minutes”. He also translated novel wrote by David Mitchell ''[[Number 9 Dream]]''. In 2009 he became a dubbing director and translator of the film ''Enemies of Society'' with [[Johnny Depp]] in the leading role.

==The way of translator==
During the period of being the interpreter Oleksa Nehrebets'kyi changed 14 [[aliases]]: Azenko, Bukovskyi, Vedenko, Hlaholenko and others (according to the letters of Ukrainian [[alphabet]]). The main reason of  this change was that the author was afraid to discredit his real name, if some translation fails.
Being a biologist by profession Oleksa Nehrebets'kyi chooses the profession of the [[interpreter]].

Oleksa himself explains: "It began when I was studying German at school and at university. When I was studying in the first and second courses, I was even [[nicknamed]] like 'Deutsch'. Then somewhere in my third year I lived in a dormitory, where foreign students lived. They knew only English (and some of them didn’t), so I had  to learn this 'language of interethnic communication' hastily." After learning the general basics, he had to work in a newspaper called ''The Voice''. According to the author’s words it was a body of so-called inter-regional deputy's club, which included Lanovyi, Cherniak, Javorivskyi.

Leonid Dmytrenko, as a Ukrainian translator passed hard way to success. In the field of translation he came in the early 1990s, when television speeches were Russian and foreign films were poorly dubbed. Oleksa Nehrebets'kyi activity started on [[ICTV (Ukraine)|ICTV]] channel in 1992 and when there was a deficit of high-quality translation. According to his words translations were made mainly by lawyers, doctors, radio engineers and not by qualified interpreters and linguists. Referring to the difficulties of translation work, it should be noted that not everything is as simple as it seems. When dubbing film translator should pay attention to the fact that phrase uttered by character must be equal to his articulation – it means complete synchronization of audio and visual sets. Professionally, it's called “lipsyng". Here imagination and ingenuity must be used, because it is not so simply to convey the main idea according to the «lipsyng – compliance” principle. Moreover, translating jokes is also difficult, especially foreign realities and movie titles. Of course, it's hard. Different languages, different [[cultures]].

There is an eternal debate between translators - is it necessary to translate each word or the whole thing - a book, a movie. Oleksa Nehrebets'kyi says that it is necessary to translate a piece of culture, not every single word. But probably the biggest array of «underwater stones " are [[songs]] that require not only accurate translation, but compliance of rhyme and rhythm. On the question "What is the translation happiness" Oleksa Nehrebets'kyi answers that it's "director who understands you, or if you are the director for yourself." Among most successful works he points out such as “Coralline in the Land of Nightmares”, “Paul”, “Ted”
