'''AWS Truepower, LLC''' is a renewable energy consulting company. It is headquartered in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], with offices in [[Denver]], [[Brazil]], [[Spain]], [[Canada]], and [[India]].

It offers a variety of services supporting renewable energy project development, and operations for offshore wind energy, onshore wind energy, and solar. These include resource mapping, energy assessment, project engineering, due diligence, performance evaluation, data monitoring, data collection, and power production forecasting. The company's general clients are developers, investors, governments and institutions.<ref>[https://www.awstruepower.com/about-us/overview awstruepower.com]</ref>

== History ==
AWS Truepower was started in 1981 under the name Associated Weather Services. Initially, the company, composed of research meteorologists from New York State University at Albany, provided atmospheric field measurements, air quality studies, forensic meteorology for lawsuits and insurance claims, and solar and wind energy feasibility studies. The company became a subsidiary of W.S. Flemming & Associates, an energy consulting firm, in 1983 which resulted in its incorporation under the name Associated Weather Services, Inc.

AWS gained its first substantial clients in the years to follow with their consulting efforts chiefly surrounding Niagara Mohawk, presently known as National Grid. Due to the large scale of business from Niagara Mohawk and the US Environmental Protection Agency, founders of the company, Bruce Bailey and Ron Stewart, became 50-50 partners after W.S. Flemming & Associates chose to sell AWS in 1985. Bailey purchased Stewart’s stake in the company in 1990 resulting in complete ownership. The same year, AWS underwent a name change to AWS Scientific to communicate that the company satisfied not only weather and technology needs, but also engineering services related to solar, wind energy project development, and air quality research.

In 1997, AWS Scientific, Brower & Company, and MESO Inc. joined forces to form a new, equal ownership company: Truewind Solutions. This move pushed AWS Scientific into the wind power industry and initiated the development of the advanced wind mapping and forecasting applications the company offers today. In 2004, the two companies AWS Scientific and Truewind Solutions consolidated to form AWS Truewind LLC. In 2007, AWS Truewind entered into a joint venture called “Meteosim Truewind, S.L.” with Barcelona Spain based Meteosim. In 2011 AWS Truewind and Meteosim merged to form what is today, AWS Truepower.<ref>[<https://www.awstruepower.com/about-us/overview/company-timeline/]</ref>

In 2013 the company has achieved over 30 years of experience in the renewable energy industry making it one of the oldest consultants in the renewable energy industry.<ref>[<https://www.awstruepower.com/about-us/overview/company-timeline/]</ref>

== Software ==

In addition to consulting services, AWS Truepower offers software solutions that are primarily aimed at wind energy developers seeking to develop wind farms or conduct an analysis of a potential project area's wind resource.

=== Windographer ===
Windographer, owned by AWS Truepower, is a software for analyzing, visualizing, and validating wind resource data from meteorological towers and remote sensing systems.<ref>[https://www.awstruepower.com/news-events/news-item/aws-truepower-acquires-windographer/]</ref> This data is fundamental to accurately estimating the amount of energy that will be produced by wind projects. AWS Truepower purchased the Windographer software assets from Mistaya Engineering, Inc. on December 28, 2014.<ref>[https://www.awstruepower.com/news-events/news-item/aws-truepower-acquires-windographer/]</ref> Windographer features data visualization, quality control, and data analysis tools for projects developers in the wind energy industry.<ref>[http://www.windographer.com/features/perform-advanced-analyses]</ref>

=== openWind ===
openWind, created by AWS Truepower, is a wind farm development software used in the wind energy industry. The program is unique in that it is built around standard GIS data types and employs a GIS- style interface to allow seamless integration of geographic and modeling data. openWind is comparable to WindFarmer and WindPRO in its ability to calculate turbine wake impacts and energy yield based on site conditions and the available resource. The software uses modeled wind-flow data known as Wind Resource Grids and data from meteorological towers to calculate wind farm energy production. openWind has a slightly different version of the Eddy Viscosity wake model featured in WindFarmer. It also has the Modified Park model which is employed by WindPRO. openWind is designed to be used by scientists, wind analysts and engineers to design wind farms. openWind was released in October 2008 at the Canadian Wind Energy Associations Annual Conference and Trade Show.<ref>[http://software.awstruepower.com/openwind/blog/]</ref>

=== windNavigator ===
windNavigator is a web based prospecting and project siting application that allows users to purchase wind resource data including wind speed, distribution, wind rose, and monthly and diurnal data for wind farm siting and analysis. windNavigator is based on the interactive GoogleMaps and enables users to search for prospective land areas for a wind farm and purchase high resolution GIS data via the internet for thorough planning. The high-resolution data has a standard error of margin of 0.35&nbsp;m/s at 80 meters.<ref>[https://www.awstruepower.com/products/dashboards/ AWS Truepower Dashboards]</ref>
