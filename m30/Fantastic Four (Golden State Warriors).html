The '''fantastic four''' are four basketball stars for the [[Golden State Warriors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) that will begin to play together at the start of the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. The fantastic four consists of [[Stephen Curry]], [[Klay Thompson]], [[Draymond Green]], and [[Kevin Durant]]. The fantastic four started off with just Stephen Curry at the start of the [[2009-10 NBA season]] until two seasons later, the Warriors drafted Klay Thompson in the first round of the [[2011 NBA Draft]], which would then form the "Splash Bros" and then, the Warriors would draft Draymond Green in the second round of the [[2012 NBA Draft]] to form the "Big Three", who would play together for four seasons and make the playoffs all four seasons playing together, including leading the Warriors to two trips to the [[NBA Finals]] and an NBA Championship in [[2015 NBA Finals|2015]], before the Warriors signed Kevin Durant to officially form the "Fantastic Four".

==Formation==

===Stephen Curry (2009-2011)===
The first of the "fantastic four" to join the Golden State Warriors was Stephen Curry, who was selected in the first round by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the [[2009 NBA Draft]]. Stephen Curry had a strong rookie year as he averaged 17.5 points, 5.9 assists, and 1.9 steals per game<ref name="Curry stats">{{cite web|title=Stephen Curry NBA Stats|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html|publisher=Basketball Reference|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> and finished second in [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA Rookie of the Year]] voting to [[Tyreke Evans]] of the [[Sacramento Kings]] and was named to the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|NBA All-Rookie First Team]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kings' Evans takes home T-Mobile Rookie of Year award|url=http://www.nba.com/2010/news/04/29/ROY.release/|publisher=NBA Official Website|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>

Stephen Curry was also strong in his sophomore season as he averaged 18.6 points, 5.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game and shot a league-best 93.4 percent at the free throw line, and he also won the 2011 [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]].<ref name="Curry stats"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/curry_sportsmanship_050511.html |title=Stephen Curry Wins 2010–11 NBA Sportsmanship Award |work=NBA.com |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> Despite his strong efforts, Stephen Curry was not able to get the Warriors to the playoffs in his first two seasons with the Warriors.

===Add Klay Thompson - "Splash Bros" (2011-2012)===
The Warriors deafted Klay Thompson with the 11th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, thus forming what would be later known as the "[[Splash Brothers|Splash Bros]]". Klay Thompson really grew up in his rookie season but the two of them could not get the Warriors in the playoffs in their first season together as Stephen Curry had a injury-riddled season that year.

===Add Draymond Green - "Big Three" (2012-2016)===
The Warriors made big improvements for the [[2012-13 NBA season]] as they drafted [[Harrison Barnes]] and [[Festus Ezeli]] in the first round of the 2012 NBA Draft, but the biggest addition came when they drafted [[Draymond Green]] in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft and traded for [[Andrew Bogut]] from the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], thus beginning to form a squad that would dominate in the NBA lead by the "Big Three" of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.

The "Big Three" were able to lead the Warriors to the playoffs for the first time since [[2007 NBA Playoffs|2007]] and just the second time since [[1994 NBA Playoffs|1994]]. Other highlights of the sea on included Stephen Curry setting an NBA record for single-season three-pointers with 272 and the "Splash Bros" combining for a combined-NBA record of 483 three-pointers that season. Klay Thompson got the playoff push started for the Warriors with 22 points in Game 1, but the Warriors fell to the [[Denver Nuggets]] 97-95. Stephen Curry would carry the Warriors through the rest of the first round as he had 30 points in Game 2, 29 points in Game 3, 31 points in Game 4, and 22 points in Game 5 to lift the Warriors past the Nuggets in a six-game series. Stephen Curry would get off to a stung start in the second round playoff series against the [[San Antonio Spurs]] with 44 points in Game 1, but the Warriors fell to the Spurs in double overtime by a score of 129-127. Klay Thompson would lift the Warrors in Game 2 with a 34-point performance to lead the Warriors to a 100-91 win in Game 2. The Spurs would go on to beat the Warriors in six games, thus knocking the Warriors out of the playoffs.

The Warriors took more steps toward rebuilding their dominant roster [[2013-14 NBA season|the following season]] be signing Denver Nuggets swingman [[Andre Iguodala]] and big man [[Marreese Speights]]. Despite being plagued by injuries early on, the Warriors bounced back in the second half of the season and the "Big There" led the Warriors to the playoffs as the #6 seed. Accomplishments by the "Big Three" that season included Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson finishing first and second in the NBA in three-pointers made that season with 261 and 223, respectively<ref>{{cite news|last=Simmons|first=Rusty|title=NBA preview: Curry, Thompson could be NBA’s best guard combo|date=October 25, 2014|work=SFGate|url=http://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Warriors-Curry-Thompson-could-be-NBA-s-best-5846245.php|archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/6WK3Ii4F9|archivedate=August 2, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref> and the "Splash Bros" extending their record for combined three-pointers made in a season by combining for 484 three-ponters.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prince|first=DeAnte|title=Thompson, Curry believe Warriors will keep 'Splash Brothers' backcourt intact|date=July 28, 2014|work=Sporting News|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2014-07-28/warriors-trade-rumors-klay-thompson-kevin-love-wolves-cavaliers-stephen-curry-wolves|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6WJwxP7R4|archivedate=August 2, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Klay Thompson]] got things started for the Warriors in the [[2014 NBA Playoffs]] as he had 22 points in Game 1 of their first round series against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and made one of two free throws to put the Warriors ahead 109-105 and essentially seal the win for the Warriors as they took a 1-0 series lead.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20140419/GSWLAC/gameinfo.html Warriors beat Clippers 109-105 in playoff opener] Retrieved August 2, 2016</ref> The Warriors would then get blown out in Game 2 and the series would be even at one game a piece.

The "Big Three" and the Warriors got the last piece they needed for their dominance in the NBA when they hired [[Steve Kerr]] to replace [[Mark Jackson]]. The Warriors would then have an incredible [[2014-15 NBA season]], in which they had a 67-15 record, which was the best record in the NBA that season and the most wins in franchise history, a home record of 39-2, which was the second-best in NBA history, Stephen Curry breaking his own record for single season three-pointers made with 286, and he and Klay Thompson combining to made a combined NBA record of 525 three-pointers, Klay Thompson setting a new NBA record for most points scored in a quarter by scoring 37 points in the third quarter of a January 23, 2015 game against the [[Sacramento Kings]],<ref name=new_nba_record>{{cite news|title=New NBA record: Klay Thompson explodes with 37 points in a single quarter|date=January 24, 2015|work=tvnz.co.nz|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/basketball-news/new-nba-record-klay-thompson-explodes-37-points-in-single-quarter-6223464|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VobpGR02|archivedate=August 2, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref> and Stephen Curry being named the 2015 [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP]], becoming the first Warrior to do so since [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in 1960. The Warriors would ease out to wins against the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] in the first two games of their first round series. In Game 3, Stephen Curry had a 40-point night to lead the Warriors to a comeback from a 20-point deficit against the Pelicans which was capped off by a game-tying three-pointer in the final seconds of regulation to send the game to overtime and go on to lead the Warriors to a 123-119 win on overtime to take a 3-0 series lead.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20150423/GSWNOP/gameinfo.html Warriors
