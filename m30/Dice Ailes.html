==Life and Early Career==

Born and bred in Victoria Island, [[Lagos]] as Shasha Damilola Alesh to a Nigerian Father and Ghanaian Mom, Dice Ailes's first experience with music was at the church choir where he beat boxed to music composed and rehearsed for church services by his Uncles. Dice always confessed his love for music to his mother who was never convinced because he couldn’t sum up the courage to perform in front of her, but this changed when at 15, he saved up to pay for what will ultimately become his first single I CANT WAIT ft RADO (his Uncle). Before the age of 16, Dice had aired his single on Rhythm 93.7, which earned him an appearance on DJ Jimmy Jatt's "Jimmy's Jump Off". Dice migrated to Canada with his family and continued to further his education. There he met Stephen Oruwari (alias Tee Tash) a young entrepreneur who had a keen interest in Dice Ailes’ talent. Tee Tash signed him to a Recording/Production Agreement and they began making good music. In 2013, Dice and Tash made a trip to Nigeria to promote Dice Ailes’ music and a turn of events led them to [[M.I Abaga]] who then was the VP of Chocolate City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thenet.ng/2014/07/chocolate-city-signs-canada-based-artiste-dice-ailes/|author=Osagie Alonge|title=Chocolate City signs Canada-based artiste Dice Ailes
