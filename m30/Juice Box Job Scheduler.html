== Job scheduling model ==
The data model used in Juice Box has a many-to-many relationship between jobs and schedules. This is similar to products such as [[SQL Server Agent]] and offers similar benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189237.aspx#Benefits|title=Benefits of SQL Server Agent|publisher=Microsoft Corporation}}</ref> Furthermore, a job can consist of multiple execution steps which are performed in series, with the option of a failed step terminating the rest of the series.

The job step types offered are Command Line and Data Source.The latter is a convenience for steps that need to execute database commands or operations. Both types can be used within a single job.

The job scheduling model supports traditional job scheduling requirements and does not offer [[workload automation]] features.

== Requirements ==
Juice Box supports Windows, Linux/Unix and Mac and requires Java 1.6 or above.
