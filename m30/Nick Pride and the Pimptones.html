'''Nick Pride and the Pimptones''' are a [[funk]]/[[jazz]]/[[soul]] band based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. The Pimptones were formed in 2007 by guitarist, composer and arranger Nick Pride. Their record label Record Kicks describes them as ''"a deep funk / jazz-dance outfit playing original material in the style of The Meters, JTQ and Charlie Hunter. The group is equally at home in a noisy nightclub or intimate jazz setting, and is most likely to bring the roof of either down with their heavy dancefloor grooves, big breaks and sophisticated jazz numbers"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkicks.com/artists/NICK-PRIDE-THE-PIMPTONES |title=Nick Pride & The Pimptones |language=it |publisher=Record Kicks |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref>

=="It's the Pimptones"==
In the original line up, Pride was joined by Oscar Cassidy (drums), Ian 'dodge' Paterson (bass),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgebass.co.uk |title=DodgeBass |publisher=DodgeBass |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> Dave Wilde (sax and flute) and Alex Leathard (trombone). This first incarnation of the band can be heard on the debut release "It’s The Pimptones"(Jazz Girl Records).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Jazz%20Girl%20Records |title=Jazz Girl Records - CDs and Vinyl at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref>

In 2009 the band released the 7" single "Deeper Pimp" on Wack Records,<ref>https://www.kudosrecords.co.uk/release/w07/nick-pride-the-pimptones-the-breakbeat-junkie-deeper-pimp-turn-it-up.html</ref> which went on to enjoy extended radioplay across Europe including the [[Craig Charles]] [[The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show|Funk and Soul Show]] on [[BBC 6]] and became the first of the group’s trademark "Live-Band Bootlegs", a unique approach to the Mash-Up genre, and a show stopping live feature. The success of the single helped ensure more live opportunities for the Pimptones and promoters in the North-East drafted the group in to support touring acts such as [[Maceo Parker]], [[Candi Staton]], [[Youngblood Brass Band]] and [[Hot 8 Brass Band]].

=="Midnight Feast of Jazz"==
The departure of the first horn section and the arrival of the new horn section (Keith Nicholson and Tomas Quilliam) heralded the start of the new line up for the Pimptones and a new tougher funkier sound. 2011 saw the release of the single "Waitin’ So Long feat Jess Roberts",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkicks.com/releases/Waitin-So-Long-Lay-It-On-The-Line |title=Waitin' So Long / Lay It On The Line |language=it |publisher=Record Kicks |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> and later the album "Midnight Feast of Jazz"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkicks.com/releases/Midnight-Feast-Of-Jazz |title=Midnight Feast Of Jazz |language=it |publisher=Record Kicks |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> featuring Jess Roberts, Susan Hamilton and Zoe Gilby, both on Milan based label Record Kicks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkicks.com |title=home |language=it |publisher=Record Kicks |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> This album was well received with reviews calling it ''"a very strong debut by Nick Pride here that you can dance to or just sit back and groove to"'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basic-soul.co.uk/reviews/Nick-Pride-and-Pimptones-Midnight-Feast-of-Jazz-review-906.htm |title=Nick Pride & Pimptones - Midnight Feast of Jazz: Basic Soul Review |publisher=Basic-soul.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> ''"A refreshing blast of energy and musical enthusiasm"''

=="Re-juiced Phat Shake"==

The Pimptones third studio album "Re-juiced Phat Shake" was released on Legere Recordings<ref>https://legererecordings.bandcamp.com/album/rejuiced-phat-shake</ref> on Valentines day 2014 and featured a host of guest singers creating a much more varied sound from the previous album "Midnight Feast of Jazz". Nick Pride states "I was always a fan of amazing pop songwriters like Burt Bacharach and Holland-Dozier-Holland, but on the other hand, being a dedicated musician, I love the raw energy of being on stage with a funk band".<ref>https://legererecordings.bandcamp.com/album/rejuiced-phat-shake</ref> The album was well received by reviews saying ''"The emphasis is on songwriting backed with energetic, tight funky playing"''; ''"an album filled with soulfully deep and satisfying recordings that are light on filler yet heavy on grooves to keep your body shaking to the beat"'';<ref>http://www.basic-soul.co.uk/reviews/Nick-Pride-and-The-Pimptones-Reduced-Phat-Shake-review-1045.htm</ref>''"one of the most exciting albums of 2014"''.<ref>http://www.willwork4funk.com/new-video45-by-jazz-funk-breakbeaters-nick-pride-the-pimptones</ref>

With the departure of sax player Tomas Quilliam to set up his own business <ref>http://www.quilliambrothers.com</ref> John Waugh was brought on board as the new full-time sax player.

=="Go Deep"==
With the sudden departure of John Waugh (sax) to join [[The 1975]]<ref>http://www.johnwaughmusic.com/</ref> both Alex Saxon (sax) and Beth Macari (vocals) were brought in to re-focus the band towards a more old school funk & soul sound. The result of this is the new album "Go Deep" recorded live in Newcastle upon Tyne in Aug 2105 at Loft Studios<ref>http://www.loftmusicstudios.co.uk/</ref> and being released on Légère Recordings in June 2016.

==Live Performances / Airplay==

The group’s touring schedule has also taken them to many of the UK’s finest funk venues including the [[100 Club]], The Yardbird in Birmingham, Band on The Wall in Manchester, Hi-Fi Club in Leeds, the Jazzbar in Edinburgh, as well as festivals such as The Mostly Jazz Festival,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mostlyjazz.co.uk/2010/line-up/nick_pride_and_the_pimptones/ |title=Nick Pride and the Pimptones - Mostly Jazz Festival 2011 – 1st-3rd July Birmingham, Jazz, Funk and Soul |publisher=Mostlyjazz.co.uk |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> The North East Funk and Soul Revue and The Sage Gateshead International Jazz Festival.
