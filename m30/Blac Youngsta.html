==Career==
Youngsta first became known regionally after his 2014 hit single, ''Heavy'', from his third mixtape, ''Fast Bricks 3''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://heavy.com/news/2016/01/blac-youngsta-sam-benson-rapper-handcuffed-stopped-by-police-outside-atlanta-bank-200000-200k/|title=Blac Youngsta: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|first=Stephanie|last=Dube Dwilson|publisher=[[Heavy.com]]|date=9 January 2016|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> He later caught the attention of [[Yo Gotti]], another hip hop recording artist from his area, from appearing in one of Gotti’s videos, which landed a meeting with his label and latter meeting with Gotti himself, and gave Youngsta an opportunity to tour with him for two months. After the tour ended, Gotti decided to sign him to his [[Yo Gotti#Collective Music Group|CMG]] record label and [[Epic Records]] in 2015.<ref>http://bossip.com/1232041/must-be-nice-you-wont-believe-the-200k-signing-present-yo-gotti-just-gifted-his-new-artist-black-youngsta-video/</ref><ref name="Signed"/>
