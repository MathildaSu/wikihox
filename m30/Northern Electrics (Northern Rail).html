'''Northern Electrics''' are electric commuter rail services introduced in 2015, and operated by [[Northern Rail]], a British [[train operating company]] owned by [[Serco-Abellio]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abellio.com/our-businesses/abellio-group-head-office|title=Abellio Group Head Office|website=Abellio Group|accessdate=20 Jun 2015|quote=In the UK we operate buses through Abellio London & Surrey, as well as Abellio Greater Anglia train services, and Merseyrail and Northern Rail in joint ventures with Serco.}}</ref> a joint venture between [[Serco]] and [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]]. The services operate on the [[Liverpool to Manchester lines]].

As a result of complete electrification of these lines by state track operator [[Network Rail]], they became capable of taking more trains at a higher speed, with raised punctuality, reliability with less pollution than diesel. The first complete day of Northern Electrics services was 22 May 2015.

==History==

State rail infrastructure owner [[Network Rail]] began electrification of the lines between Manchester and Liverpool in 2013 as part of its [[Northern Hub]] upgrade programme.<ref name=nwe>{{Cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/North_West_electrification.aspx|title=North West electrification|accessdate=2 Jun 2015|quote=Manchester to Liverpool, and Huyton to Wigan: by early 2015...Preston to Blackpool: by Winter 2016/17}}</ref>  The work was completed in February 2015.

The first electric services between Liverpool and Manchester commenced on March 5, 2015{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}—the first service operated by Northern Electrics being the Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Airport route.<ref name=nr12feb2015 />

As part of Northern Rail's plans for operation of the newly electrified Liverpool to Manchester lines, an initial 20 [[British Rail Class 319|Class 319/3]] units were transferred from [[Thameslink|Thameslink and Great Northern]] following a repaint and internal refresh.<ref name=nr12feb2015>{{cite web|title=Northern Launches New Look Electric Trains|url=http://www.northernrail.org/news/7597|website=Northern Rail|accessdate=20 Jun 2015|date=12 Feb 2015|quote=Since taking ownership of the first of 20 trains in summer 2014, work to give them all a fresh and exciting new look has been ongoing.  The trains, which will start running on the newly electrified line between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Airport once work on the route is complete, ... The Class 319 trains have had extensive cosmetic work done ahead of their maiden journeys with striking new look exterior paintwork, as well as refreshed and modernised interiors which include new paintwork and improved seating for a more comfortable journey.}}</ref>
12 units launched the services early in 2015, with the remaining 8 units due to enter traffic for Northern Electrics in September the same year.

The Class 319s have largely replaced [[British Rail Class 142|Class 142 ''Pacer'']], [[British Rail Class 150|Class 150 ''Sprinter'']] and [[British Rail Class 156|Class 156 ''Express Sprinter'']] diesel multiple unit stock that were once the mainstay of services between Liverpool and Manchester.

==Branding==
The Northern Electrics livery is different to the standard Northern Rail livery - featuring "Northern Electrics" logos and a different design which has a greater emphasis on purple.

==Stops==
The main stations are: Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Victoria, Manchester Airport, Liverpool Lime Street and Wigan North Western.
Other stops include: Newton Le Willows, Roby, Huyton, Earlestown  and Wavertree Technology Park.
Future stops include: Preston, Blackpool North.

==Routes==
{{as of|May 2015}}, the routes operated by Northern Electrics are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Sitting Pretty In More Seats in Manchester and Liverpool Stations|url=http://www.northernrail.org/news/7683|website=Northern Rail|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>

* [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]] to [[Manchester Airport station|Manchester Airport]] (1 tph)
* Liverpool Lime Street to [[Manchester Victoria railway station|Manchester Victoria]] (1 tph)
* Liverpool Lime Street to [[Wigan North Western railway station|Wigan North Western]] (2 tph)

Also, some services between Preston and Liverpool are Class 319 electric trains, but the majority of services are diesel, as many of these services extend to/from Blackpool which is still unelectrified. As of the May 2015 timetable change, there is only one Class 319 per day to Preston. which leaves Liverpool Lime Street at 1800 on Monday to Fridays only(DMU on a Saturday). This is the only Class 319 to operate north of Wigan, as there is no return electric service. All other services returning from Preston are DMUs. 

Further services between Liverpool/Manchester and Preston/Blackpool will be added when [[Network Rail]] completes electrification of the [[Preston to Blackpool line]]s in 2017.<ref name=nwe />{{update after|2018}}
