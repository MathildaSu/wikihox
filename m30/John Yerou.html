John Yerou is the owner, founder and managing director of Freelancer Financials, a brand of Mortgage Quest Ltd.<ref>http://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/your-community/2016/02/24/66722/</ref>
==Personal life and Career==

John George Yerou was born on June 23, 1964 in [[London]] to Cypriot parents Androulla and George Yerou. He grew up in North West London and attended William Gladstone High School and then Willesden College of Technology.  He married Samantha Hayward in 1994 and with whom he has two sons. They live in Chalfont St. Giles, [[South Bucks]]. 

After completing his degree in 1988 Yerou joined [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] to commence a career in Sales & Marketing. He joined Data & Control Equipment Ltd in 1991 to expand their international markets. When he left the company in September 1995 he was the Sales & Marketing Manager. He was then contacted by Motorola to run their subsidiary Telular Inc. in Singapore. Telular was a [[Nasdaq]] listed company focused on wireless technology. He went on to serve as the Vice President of Telular for four years being responsible for the Asia/Pacific region.  After the Telular position he undertook a one year contract with Amper S.A., a Spanish multinational technology company that trades in the [[Madrid Stock Exchange]], to restructure their operations in South East Asia.

In 2000 Yerou returned to the United Kingdom with his family to live in Chalfont St. Giles, [[South Bucks]]. He then went on to run the sales operation for Argus Systems (UK) for two years followed by International Presence Group. 

==Mortgage Quest Ltd==

After holding senior management positions in several companies Yerou started his company Mortgage Quest Ltd in 2004. The company began as a general mortgage brokerage firm, but soon specialised in providing mortgage and financial advice to contractors, freelancers and independent self-employed professionals.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/17/freelancer-workers-get-mortgage</ref> The following brands were established to promote these specialist mortgage services; Freelancer Financials, Contractor Mortgages®, C&F Mortgages and Self-Employed Mortgages.

==Freelancer Financials==

Whilst running Mortgage Quest Ltd. John Yerou gained first-hand experience of how extremely difficult it was to secure mortgages for contractors and Freelancers<ref>http://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/news/2016/01/25/self-cert-lender-accused-of-supporting-tax-dodgers/</ref> and as a result Freelancer Financials was set up in 2008 after identifying a gap in the mortgage industry for independent financial advice tailored to the growing contractor and freelancer market. 
Yerou subsequently set out to change Lenders’ biased attitudes towards contractors and freelancers. By negotiating the underwriting criteria for assessing a contractor’s relevant earnings for lending purposes, those lenders’ perceptions changed. The resultant products are now commonly referred to as contractor mortgages, enabling contractors to borrow based on a multiple of their contract rate alone. 

Freelancer Financials remains family owned and has grown to a 25-person company.
