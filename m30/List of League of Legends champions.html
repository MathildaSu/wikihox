The ''[[League of Legends]]'' video game features a wide cast of characters involved in the game; they may either come as NPCs, or as playable champions (which form a large majority of the cast).  The champions all reside in the fictional world of [[Runeterra]] whose landscape and geography has been significantly altered by the excessive use of magic in past disputes and wars.  In order to prevent further damage to the land, a group of summoners, powerful magicians and often called as political leaders in Runeterra, have decided to form the ''League of Legends'', an organization which would serve to mediate future political conflicts through sanctioned battles. Although primarily to keep peace between the two major city states; Demacia and Noxus, individuals who enter the League of Legends can come from a wide range of regions in Runeterra.  Those that have been chosen to participate in these battles are considered as champions.

==Creation and conception==
Riot Games releases new champions for League of Legends frequently, around every 1~3 months, with each champion having a unique set of skills and play style.  Some champions specialize in quickly subduing their opponents with a flurry of spells, while others are capable of soaking up plenty of damage or are able to effectively disrupt an opponent champion's movements.

Part of the development process for the champions involves drawing in inspiration from many sources, some of which coming from popular media at the time of creation.<ref name=""getting together in a room, [putting] up pictures, [getting] any inspiration that is awesome, and as a group of creative people, look at them and say "What can we do with this?""">{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs1yD8m2fvE | title=League of Legends Champions Retrospective | publisher=Riot Games Inc. | date=16 August 2012 | accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>  For example, the champion Elise's dance animation is based off the [[Can-Can]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0d9J8ydaNA | title=Elise - The Can-Can - League of Legends (LoL) Dance | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=14 February 2014 | author=NeiLalwaysLeeT}}</ref>

== Demacian Champions ==

===Fiora Laurent===
:Title: The Grand Duelist
:Release Date: {{date|2012-02-29}}

:Fiora is well known in Demacia as both for her skill as a duelist and for her sharp tongue. Coming from a family of duelists, she had always aimed for greatness and longed to match, or even surpass, her father's skill.  Her father was, however, caught undermining an opponent for an arranged duel through the use of poison, ruining the Laurent family's reputation and placing a shadow of a doubt on Fiora's own honor.  Out of desperation, she had challenged and defeated her father in a duel, seizing control of House Laurent and set out to re-establish her name not as the greatest duelist in Demacia but of all of Valoran.<ref name="Fiora | League of Legends">{{cite web | title=League of Legends | accessdate=20 February 2014 | url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/fiora/ | title=Fiora the Grand Duelist}}</ref>

:Title: The Sentinel's Sorrow
:Release Date: {{date|2010-08-10}}

:Galio was a result of Runeterra's mages experimentation with artificial life, created by a Demacian craftsman by the name of Durand.  Made in the image of a gargoyle, Durand was protected by Galio during his journeys and allowed him to perform his work without any fear of being attacked by Noxians.  In one journey, however, Galio was outnumbered by Noxian assassins and his ward was quickly killed.  Without any reason to go on, he stood over his creator's remains for years till a mournful but resolute [[#Poppy|yordle girl]] with a Demacian crown rested under her shadow.  Within the girl's burden and determination, Galio remembered the cause that his master had died for and created a new purpose for himself: to join the League of Legends and fight for Demacia.<ref name="Galio | League of Legends">{{cite web | url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/galio/ | title=Galio the Sentinel's Sorrow | accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>
