'''Niagara Public School''', today known as '''BranCliff Inn''', was a public school in ''Newark'' in the [[Province of Canada]] (today's [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], [[Ontario]]). The school house is located at 40 Platoff Street in the [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic District]] known as ''Niagara-on-the-Lake'' or ''Old Town''.

The construction of the school was a result of ''The Great Swap'', the first and largest surrender of a portion of the military reserve around [[Fort Mississauga]] since its boundaries were created in 1796. The portion of land was sold to the Honourable James Crooks, who in 1854 sold a partial lot to the Town Council of Niagara for "uses of Common Schools and Grammar Schools in the Town of Niagara forever."<ref name=merritt-page109>{{cite book|author=Richard D.

The large two-storey brick building was built in 1859 as a public school, serving the town's children until 1948 when the new [[Parliament Oak School]] was built nearby.<ref name=merritt-page109/><ref name=dale>{{cite book|author=Dale, R.J. |title=Niagara-on-the-Lake: Its heritage and its festival |page=68 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QaXFkTgUBfsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Niagara-on-the-Lake&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Niagara-on-the-Lake&f=false }}</ref> One of its first principals was Janet Carnochan, who later became a prolific chronicler of the history of the Niagara area and a key figure in the development of local historical societies and museums in Ontario, including the founding of the Niagara Historical Society and the [[Niagara Public Library]].<ref name=murray>{{cite book|author=Murray, H. |title=Come, Bright Improvement!: The Literary Societies of Nineteenth-century Ontario |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2002 |page=281}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandycline.com/history |title=Janet Carnochan |publisher=sandycline.com}}</ref> The school house served elementary grades and had four classrooms, two on each floor. The school was used until 1948, after which it was converted into a four unit apartment building. In 2005 it was converted into a [[bed and breakfast]], and in 2012 renamed the ''BranCliff Inn''.
 
The National Historic Site designation of the historic district, in 2003, includes buildings built from 1815 to 1859 in a 25 block area having "location close to the [[Niagara River]] on Front Street and extending approximately four blocks north to Castlereagh Street".<ref name=crhp>{{CRHP|14623|Niagara-on-the-Lake}}  Note: Supporting documentation is located at National Historic Sites Directorate, Documentation Centre, 5th Floor, Room 89, 25 Eddy Street, Gatineau, Quebec.</ref> The entire block that includes the school is included in the district.<ref>See map of historic district within historic plaque: [[Niagara Public School#/media/File:Niagara Public School Shawe 1946.png|File:National Historic District Map.jpg]], and verify school is within block bounded by Platoff, Davy, Castlereagh and King streets by [https://www.google.com/maps/place/40+Platoff+St,+Niagara-on-the-Lake,+ON+L0S+1J0,+Canada/@43.2529529,-79.0705232,3a,75y,123h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjU2TSZxlXhnsQN_QI5_tNA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DjU2TSZxlXhnsQN_QI5_tNA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D392%26h%3D106%26yaw%3D123.59924%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x89d35f7155d522eb:0xfc5ad43e4aa966a7!6m1!1e1 Google StreetView of April 2014]</ref>

The historic district was defined to include buildings that include various character-defining elements besides their location.  Some other qualifying elements are that the buildings may have two-story rectangular massing, an overall symmetrical composition of a five-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] facade, a central entrance, limited decoration around the main entrance and ground floor windows, use of brick construction, gabled roof sloping to the front and rear.<ref name=crhp/>  These other qualifying elements appear to be exemplified{{OR|date=March 2016}} in the Niagara Public School building.<ref name=pending>Elements can be seen in [https://www.google.com/maps/place/40+Platoff+St,+Niagara-on-the-Lake,+ON+L0S+1J0,+Canada/@43.2529529,-79.0705232,3a,75y,123h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjU2TSZxlXhnsQN_QI5_tNA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DjU2TSZxlXhnsQN_QI5_tNA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D392%26h%3D106%26yaw%3D123.59924%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x89d35f7155d522eb:0xfc5ad43e4aa966a7!6m1!1e1 Google StreetView of April 2014].  A copy of supporting documentation for the historic site designation for development of this Niagara Public School article has been requested;  the documents pending may or may not specifically verify that these elements are deemed to apply for this building.</ref>  Another qualifying element is that buildings may have had "restoration work that is sympathetic to the original appearance and character of buildings built during the 1815 to 1859 period".<ref name=crhp/>  This may also apply.{{OR|date=March 2016}}<ref name=pending/>
