'''Irl A. Gladfelter''' (born 1944) was the founder and first Metropolitan Archbishop of the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]] (ALCC) until his resignation from that position and from the ALCC on December 1, 2011.

==Biography==
Gladfelter was ordained a [[deacon]] and a [[priest]]  by [[Archbishop]] [[Peter Paul Brennan]], O.C.R. of the Ecumenical Catholic Diocese of the Americas.  He was ordained a [[bishop]] by Archbishop Brennan as well as Francis Cajetan Spataro, O.C.R., and Paget Elkinah James Mack, O.S.B.M., both of the Apostolic Episcopal Church. Gladfelter was also a life professed priest of the ALCC's [[Augustinian]] Order.<ref>[http://www.orgsites.com/ny/priestlysocietysssa/ Priestly Society of St. Augustine]</ref> 

On December 1, 2011, Gladfelter also resigned as the first [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the Augustana Catholic Communion, which is a completely separate association of "Evangelical Catholic" Lutheran and "Anglo-Catholic" Anglican churches which have [[Apostolic succession|apostolic]] orders (i.e. whose bishops are believed to have been ordained into a tactile lineal succession leading back to one or more of Christ's apostles) and share the goal of visible and corporate reunion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in whichever form is determined by that church to be the most practical.  Upon his resignation, Gladfelter returned to the Roman Catholic Church as a layman.

Gladfelter received the degree of [[Doctor of Dental Surgery]] "with distinction" from the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry]] and was a career officer in the [[Dental Corps]] of the [[United States Army]], retiring as a [[lieutenant colonel]] after serving more than 20 years on active duty.  He is a graduate (with honors) of the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]]. His military decorations include the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]] with one [[oak leaf cluster]], the [[Army Commendation Medal]] with one [[oak leaf cluster]], the [[Army Achievement Medal]], the [[National Defense Service Medal]] with one bronze [[service star]], the [[Korea Defense Service Medal]], the [[Army Overseas Service Ribbon]], and the [[Army Service Ribbon]].  Gladfelter holds a commission as a [[Kentucky colonel]].
