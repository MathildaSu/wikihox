Often the only purpose it serves is to prove youâ€™re getting older and that you no longer drive the cool car you used to drive when you were in high school, or something. Part of me dies inside when I hear a Nirvana tune â€” and I donâ€™t even really like Nirvanaâ€™s music all that much â€” sandwiched between Foreigner and Steve Miller Band on the local classic rock station. ... The following is but a sample of some of the songs that could be stricken from the airwaves and weâ€™d all be better off for it."</ref>
