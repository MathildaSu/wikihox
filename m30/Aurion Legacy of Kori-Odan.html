{{nihongo|'''''Aurion Legacy of Kori Odan'''''|''french''|Aurion: l'heritage des Koriodan}} is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing]] [[action-adventure video game]] created by [[Madiba Olivier]], developed and first published in Cameroon by [[Kiro'o Games]] stemming back to 2003. It is the first geniunely original game from west Africa. Originally designed as an overworld based game like Final fantasy the game over the time period with 2003 to 2013 shifted to side-scrolling

The story follows a young prince in Zama named Enzo, who is ambushed overthrown and exiled from his palace  in a coup led by his embittered brother-in law moments before his coronation to the throne as King of Zama as well as his Marriage to Erine of Soma.In order to regain his throne, the two must embark on a quest seeking help from the other countries, forming an alliance (some of which involve initiation rituals) to defeat his brother in law, and restore the throne, and save their kingdom.

The game received generally positive reviews, and it is regarded as one of the most influential and successful role-playing games on the Indie Game platform, playing a major role in re-popularizing a genre pioneered by [[Compile (publisher)|COMPILE]] 33 years back.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Aurion wiki.jpg|thumb|Gameplay of Enzo battling a Valley Guardian]]
''Aurion'' Depending on the world zone and cities within the game there are various map layouts each one has a destination for towns and dungeons, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct the character to various locations. The primary means of travel across the is by foot, climbing walls or any other method used in platform  but a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]],  although enemies are [[random encounter|randomly encountered]] on field maps and on the  map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.

The game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and kingdoms . Some town citizens offer helpful information, while others own shops that sell items or equipment. Dungeons appear in areas that include forests, caves, mountains, swamps, underwater caverns and buildings. Dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. The game's menu screen allows the player to keep track of their [[experience point]]s and levels, to choose which equipment their characters wield, and to use items and magic. A character's most basic attribute is their level, which can range from one to fifty, and is determined by the character's amount of experience. Gaining a level increases the character's attributes, such as their maximum [[health (gaming)|hit points]] (HP), which represents a character's remaining health; a character dies when they reach zero HP. Characters gain experience points by winning battles.

Since this is an action rpg, combat in ''Aurion'' is part menu-based part engaging: the player selects an action from a list of options such as Fight, Magic, and Item while like a traditional side scrolling beat-em-up can fend off enemies from a traditional button mashing standpoint. Battles are turn-based and continue until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character gains experience and gold; if it flees, it is returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game is over even though you are given the option to try again afterwards.

Despite Magic being a common ability in the game, direct combat is the primary function in the game fusing with the magic to be used by the player once its acquired. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive.Each Magical entity can be controlled by pressing a specific button while following a certain command formula executing it using either the keyboard or an Xbox 360 controller.

==Story==
Enzo Kori-Odan, the prince of Zama is a victim of a coup d'état orchestrated by his brother in-law on the day of his coronation and wedding with Erine Evou. The royal couple is then exiled and decides to go round the world in search of allies. They will especially have to reunite Enzo’s warring legacy in order to retrieve their throne.

Beyond retrieving their position, the dethroned Royal couple will precisely discover the geopolitical and existential dilemmas attached to their functions of King and Queen. They will have to find answers in order to secure the fate of Zama.
