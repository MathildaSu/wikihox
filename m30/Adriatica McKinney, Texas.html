'''Adriatica McKinney''' is a [[housing development]] in [[Stonebridge Ranch]], [[McKinney, Texas]] nearing completion.  It is notable for being a partial replica of the town of [[Supetar]], [[Croatia]].<ref name="adriatica_home">Adriatica McKinney [http://www.adriaticamckinney.com/ official home page]</ref><ref name="slobodna_adriatica">[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Mozaik/tabid/80/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/53692/Default.aspx "Milijun dolara za vilu u američkom Supetru"], article on Adriatica McKinney in [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] {{hr icon}}</ref>

According to news reports, the [[real estate developer|developer]] [[Jeff Blackard]] is taking pains to lend Adriatica an air of authenticity, from purchasing [[church bell]]s from Croatia, to [[Croatian language]] signs on [[waste disposal]] areas. The developer claims that [[marketing]] expenses have been minimal, as the word about the project mostly spread [[viral marketing|informally]], and that the location is becoming somewhat of a [[tourist attraction]].<ref name="slobodna_adriatica"/>
