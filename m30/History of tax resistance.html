Many [[rebellion]]s and [[revolution]]s have been prompted by resentment of taxation or had tax refusal as a component. Examples of historic events that originated as tax revolts include the [[Magna Carta]], the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=burg />

==Examples==

===Before 1500 A.D.===

====Jewish Zealots, 1st century A.D.====
{{See also|Render unto Caesar...}}
In the 1st century AD, Jewish [[Zealotry|Zealot]]s in [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] resisted the poll tax instituted by the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.), ''We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader'' (ISBN 1-4348-9825-3), pp. 1-7.</ref>  [[Jesus]] was accused of promoting tax resistance prior to his torture and execution (“We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King” — [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:2).<ref>Swartley, W. M. ''The Christian and the Payment of Taxes Used for War'', 1980 [http://peace.mennolink.org/articles/wartaxes.html Peace.mennolink.org]</ref> After the [[destruction of the temple]] in Jerusalem in 70 AD, Jews, particularly those exiled to Egypt, refused to pay the still-extant “[[temple tax]]” to Rome (which it was using to maintain pagan temples); Rome responded by destroying Jewish temples.<ref>Burg, David F. ''A World History of Tax Rebellions'' (2004), pp. 34–35.</ref>

====Limoges, 578====
In 578 AD residents of [[Limoges]], encouraged by the local clergy, rioted, destroying tax-collecting paraphernalia and threatening the assessor.  The government responded harshly, with punishments including torture and crucifixion, though Queen [[Fredegund]] later was said to have repented and rescinded the tax.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 57–58.</ref>

====Peace and Truce of God====
In councils organized by the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movement, Christian clergy resisted the exaction of taxes against church property by warlords.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 72–73.</ref>

====Danegeld, 1041====
In 1041, residents of [[Worcester]] rebelled against the [[Danegeld]] being collected by King [[Harthacnut]], and killed two of his tax collectors.  Harthacnut responded by burning Worcester to the ground.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 71–72.</ref>

====Lady Godiva′s Ride====
In the legend of [[Lady Godiva]]′s ride, Godiva continuously pleaded with [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric]] to reduce taxes on the people of [[Coventry]]. Leofric, doubting the strength of her commitment to the cause, said that he would do so if Godiva were to ride naked on a horse through the town. She called his bluff, rode in the buff, and that was enough.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 77–78.</ref>

====Constantinople, 1197====
{{Main|Alamanikon}}
When [[Alexios III Angelos]] tried to tax residents of [[Constantinople]] in order to come up with money to pay protection money to [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the people of Constantinople refused to pay, and Alexios was reduced to trying to collect the sum by stripping the ornaments from old tombs.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 79–80.</ref>

====Florence, 1289====
A war tax instituted by the Florentine seigniory in 1288 and increased in 1289 led to mass tax resistance that forced the government to abandon the tax.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 93.</ref>

====Clericis laicos, 1296====
In 1296, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] issued the [[clericis laicos]], which prohibited secular governments from taxing churches without the permission of the Pope, and prohibited church officials from paying such taxes.  Archbishop [[Robert Winchelsey]] used this as the basis for his refusal to pay taxes to [[Edward I of England]], and urged the clergy under his direction to do likewise.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 93–97.</ref>

====Norman anti-tax riots, 1348–51====
In Normandy in June 1348, tax resisters attacked the tax collectors of King [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], “pillaging and burning their houses.” In August 1351, citizens of [[Rouen]] rioted, “destroying ‘the counters, boxes, and other objects necessary to make and operate’ collection of” a new tax instituted by [[John II of France|John II]].<ref>Burg (2004), p. 114–15.</ref> In 1355, [[Geoffroy of Harcourt]] urged residents of Rouen to refuse to pay the hearth tax and allied with [[Charles the Bad]] against John II′s taxes.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 117–18.</ref>

====Wat Tyler′s rebellion, 1381====
In 1381, the [[Peasant's Revolt]] occurred in England, when [[Wat Tyler]] led an uprising over a new [[Tax per head|poll tax]]. Tyler marched an army of tens of thousands of peasants from [[Kent]] to [[Canterbury]], then to [[London]],  beheaded the archbishop, and exacted radical concessions from King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. During the negotiations, Tyler was killed by officers of the King and was publicly beheaded, and Richard II retracted all of the concessions that he had previously made.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 128–30.<br />[http://taxjustice.blogspot.com/2009/07/tax-justice-in-history-peasants-revolt.html “Tax Justice in History: The Peasant's Revolt”], ''Tax Justice Network'', 12 July 2009.</ref>

====French aides uprisings, 1381====
In 1381 there was widespread tax rebellion in France.
<blockquote>
In Rouen workers in the textile trade gathered in the Old Market, chose one of their own to represent the king, and had this mock king sign acts abolishing the ''aides''. In Paris the collectors′ threat to seize a greengrocer′s still on the Right Bank roused local residents to assemble, shout “Down with taxes!” and chase off the tax collectors.... The rebellion then spread to Caen and other towns in Normandy and to towns in Picardy, where opposition was especially virulent in Amiens.  It moved through Orleans and on to Sens, finally reaching Lyons....<ref>Burg (2004), p. 127–8.</ref>
</blockquote>

====Bundschuh movement====
The [[Bundschuh movement]] was in part a tax resistance movement that encouraged its followers to stop paying tithes to the Catholic Church and taxes.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 143–4.</ref>  In France, a tithe-payer strike spread from 1529 to 1560 among both Catholics and Protestants.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 156–7.</ref>

===16th century===

====Revolt of the Comuneros, 1520====
Residents of [[Salamanca]] in 1520 refused to pay any taxes because of their belief that [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] was sending the tax money to the Netherlands.  They were joined by other towns, which eventually formed the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]].<ref>Burg (2004), p. 145–51.</ref>

====German Peasants′ War, 1524–25====
The [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524–25 was in part a tax resistance campaign.  The rebels vowed to set their own tithes, and:
<blockquote>The small tithes, whether ecclesiastical or lay, we will not pay at all, for the Lord God created cattle for the free use of man. We will not, therefore, pay farther an unseemly tithe which is of man′s invention.... Henceforth no one shall have to pay death taxes, whether small or large.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 151–54.</ref></blockquote>

====Revolt of Ghent, 1539====
The [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)]] began when the city magistrates refused to pay taxes demanded by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] for his war with France.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 158–59</ref>

====Hutterites====
In the 16th century, [[Hutterite]]s refused to pay taxes for war or [[capital punishment]]. One wrote:
<blockquote>For war, killing, and bloodshed (where it is demanded especially for that) we give nothing, but not out of wickedness or arbitrariness, but out of the fear of God (1 Timothy 5) that we may not be partakers in strange sins.<ref>Bender, Harold S. “Taxation”, ''Mennonite Encyclopedia'', Vol. IV (1959).</ref></blockquote>
Another wrote:
<blockquote>[When] the government requires of us what is contrary to our faith and conscience — as swearing oaths and paying hangman’s dues or taxes for war — then we do not obey its command.<ref>Friedmann, Robert “Claus Felbinger’s Confession of 1560” ''Mennonite Quarterly Review'' XXIX (April 1955) p. 147, and Klaassen, Walter ''Anabaptism: Neither Catholic nor Protestant'' (1973), p. 56.</ref></blockquote>

====Gabelle revolts, 1542, 1548====
Residents of [[La Rochelle]] rebelled against the [[gabelle]], or salt tax, in 1542. “[A]rmed rebels thwarted the tax-collecting efforts of two successive visitations of royal commissioners sent out to enforce the [gabelle] edicts.”<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 160–61.</ref> A second revolt centered in [[Guyenne]] in 1548 was more organized, widespread, and violent; and was violently suppressed.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 163–64.</ref> Also in August 1548, there were violent revolts against the gabelle in Bordeaux in which tax collectors were killed and their homes burnt. The French central government sent in thousands of troops who terrorized the occupants, imposed martial law, and enforced humiliating terms; however “Amazingly, in the long run, the rebellion did achieve its aim. Unnerved by the riots, Henri II decided not to enforce the salt tax.”<ref>Bakewell, Sarah ''How to Live: or, A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer'' (2010).</ref>

====Tariff resistance in Holland, 1543–49====
Merchants in Holland successfully resisted a variety of export duties imposed by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] via [[Mary of Hungary]].<ref>Burg (2004), p. 162.</ref>

====Tax strikes in France, 1579–80====
In [[Romans-sur-Isère]] and other parts of [[Dauphiné]], anti-tax leagues formed, which grew into a powerful rebellion that was crushed in the wake of the ambush and murder of many of the rebel leaders by vigilantes during the [[Carnival]] of 1580.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 174–8.</ref>

====The Revolt Against the Tribute, Philippines, 1589====
In 1589, the provinces of Cagayán, Ilocos Norte, and Ilocos Sur rebelled against unjust Spanish colonial taxes and abusive tax collectors in what became known as the “Revolt Against the Tribute,” the “Dingrás Revolt,” or the “Ilocos Norte Revolt.”<ref>''Census of the Philippine Islands'' 1905, pp. 423–24; Barrows, David Prescott ''A History of the Philippines'' pp. 163–66</ref>

====Rappenkrieg, 1591–94====
In a three-year-long tax refusal campaign called the [[Rappenkrieg (Basel)|Rappenkrieg]] or “farthing war” the residents of Basel, Switzerland refused to pay a tax destined for the bishop.<ref>Burg (2004) p. 179</ref>

====Croquants, 1593–95====
{{main|Croquant rebellions}}
Peasant rebels in southwestern France called “croquants” included “refusal to pay tithes, [[taille]]s, and rents... and resistance to tax collectors and their agents.” A second rebellion in Vivarais at the same time also centered on refusal to pay the taille.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 180–2.<br />Rothbard, Murray “Peasants, Rise Up! The Croquants of the 17th Century” in ''An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought'', vol. 1, ''Economic Thought Before Adam Smith''.</ref>

====Sales tax resistance in France, 1597====
A number of towns in France, notably [[Poitiers]], resisted the imposition of a new sales tax by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1597. The King at first stubbornly enforced the tax by force, but eventually decided the expense and fuss was not worth the income and rescinded the tax.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 186–7.</ref>

====Jelali revolts====
The [[Jelali revolts]] were typically inspired by taxes or the action of tax collectors, and included tax resistance strategies, including “The Great Flight” — a sort of mass emigration by peasants from their land to avoid taxes.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 185, 189.</ref>

===17th Century===

====Bolotnikov rebellion, 1606====
During the [[Bolotnikov rebellion]], tribes in western Siberia began refusing to pay taxes to the central government.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 190.</ref>

====Brussels, 1619====
In the city of [[Brussels]], then part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] in the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], there was a tax strike in 1619. When the [[States of Brabant]] (composed of representatives of the clergy, the nobility, and the four cities Leuven, Brussels, Antwerp and 's-Hertogenbosch) met to renew the standard sales tax on the "four species of consumption" (beer, wine, bread and meat), the guilds of the city of Brussels instructed their representatives not to vote the taxes through until their grievances had been addressed. As the constitutional principle was that taxes had to be passed by "full consent", this meant the taxes could not legally be collected. After two months of constitutional impasse and fruitless negotiations (May–June) the government ordered the taxes to be collected notwithstanding. The guilds made this impossible, and their defiance of the government led to a military occupation of the city in September 1619. The central authorities then revised the civic constitution to limit the power of the guilds to filibuster the States of Brabant. The deans of six of the guilds, and their legal counsel, were served with sentences of lifelong banishment from the Low Countries.<ref>Karin Van Honacker, ''Lokaal verzet en oproer in de 17de en 18de eeuw: Collective acties tegen het centraal gezag in Brussel, Antwerpen en Leuven'' (Standen en Landen 98, Kortrijk–Heule, 1994), pp. 97–101.</ref>

====English Civil War====
In 1627, [[John Hampden]] was imprisoned for his opposition to the loan [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] authorised without parliamentary sanction, and he also refused to pay [[ship money]] to the Royal Navy.  The attempts to imprison resisters like Hampden led to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Gross,  ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 9–16.</ref>

From the summer of 1646 through 1648, the city of [[London]] refused to pay taxes to the [[New Model Army]] which was occupying the city.<ref>Gentles, Ian “The Struggle for London in the Second Civil War”, ''The Historical Journal'', 1983.</ref>

====17th-century tax rebellions in France====
In 1615, the residents of one commune refused to pay the wine tithe and threatened to throw the collector into the Rhône.<ref name="Scott" />

In [[Poitiers]], France, in 1624 and again on multiple occasions in 1663, mobs attacked Inns where French tax farmers were staying, threatening to torch the building and kill those inside.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 192.</ref>

The success of anti-tax rebellions in [[Saintonge]] and [[Angoumois]] led to other rebellions in France, including some in which excise officers were lynched.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 201.</ref> The most notorious incident was the massacre of tax officers responsible for collecting the [[gabelle]] at [[Agen]] in June 1635.<ref>William Beik, ''Urban Protest in Seventeenth-Century France: The Culture of Retribution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. 63–72.</ref>

A second “Croquants′ Revolt” in 1636–37 (with some outbreaks as early as 1628) concerned the taxes being raised to support France′s entry into the [[Thirty Years' War]] and included the lynching of tax officials, a tax strike, and a major battle at which over 2,000 people were killed.  The major rebellion was defeated, but outbreaks of mass tax resistance continued as late as 1658.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 201–04.</ref>

From 1638 to 1645, the residents of [[Pardiac]] refused to pay their taxes, rose up to free the officials who had been imprisoned for failure to remit the tax money, repulsed government troops sent to enforce the tax laws, and massacred a tax official and his bodyguard.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 204–05.</ref>

In 1639–43, the [[revolt of the va-nu-pieds]] in Normandy included a tax strike and attacks on the homes of tax farmers.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 205–07.</ref> In 1643 there were attacks on tax collectors in multiple regions of France.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 208–9.</ref>  The [[Fronde]] of 1646–53 was also marked by anti-tax riots.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 215–9.</ref>

The [[revolt of the papier timbré]] in 1675 was centered on a new stamp tax, and included destruction of tax offices and attacks on tax- and tithe-collectors.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 224–5.</ref>

In 1682, a village curate led a tax revolt in which the villagers stoned the monks and the tithe agent who had come to collect a grain tithe.<ref name="Scott" />

====Algonquian resistance, 1637====
In 1637, the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] resisted being taxed by Dutch colonialists to pay for improvements to [[Fort Amsterdam]].<ref>[http://business.mapsofindia.com/india-tax/concepts/history-resistance.html History of Tax Resistance]</ref>

====Italian tax revolts, 1647====
{{Main|Masaniello}}
Residents of [[Palermo]] and of [[Naples]] revolted in 1647 and destroyed the tax offices and the homes of tax farmers.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 209–11; Bohn, H. F. ''The Carafas of Maddaloni: Naples under Spanish dominion'' (1854).</ref>

====Swiss peasant war of 1653====
A devaluation of Bernese money caused a tax revolt and the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]] that spread from the [[Entlebuch]] valley in the [[Canton of Lucerne]] to the [[Emmental]] valley in the [[Canton of Bern]] and then to the cantons of [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] and [[Basel]] and also to the [[Aargau]].

====Resistance to Cromwell’s Taxes-by-Decree, 1654====
In 1654, an English merchant named George Cony refused to pay customs duties that had been established by [[Oliver Cromwell]]’s government without its having bothered to go through Parliament, and thereby called into question the legal underpinnings of the whole regime.<ref>Cooper, Emily ''The History of England'' (1877), p. 181; Mackintosh, James ''The History of England'' (1836), p. 207; Godwin, William, ''History of the Commonwealth of England'' (1828), p. 174.</ref>

====Quaker Tithe and War Tax Resistance, 1659–====
[[George Fox]]′s Quaker movement included resistance to tithes and other mandatory fees destined for the establishment church. Soon, the movement also incorporated resistance to militia taxes and fees, and to “trophy money” (taxes for equipping soldiers). These were early examples of war tax resistance in the Quaker movement.<ref>see the excerpts from Margaret Hirst′s ''The Quakers in Peace and War'' at ''[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index5.php?entry=07Jul12 The Picket Line]''.</ref>

====Revolt of the papier timbré, 1675====
{{Main|Revolt of the papier timbré}}

====Scottish presbyterian dissent, 1678–88====
In the 17th century, as the reformation government in Scotland reintroduced a state episcopal church and brutally cracked down on dissident presbyterian groups, members of those groups resisted the taxes that were being raised to pay for this repression, and advocated mass tax resistance.<ref>e.g. Alexander Shields’s ''The Hind Let Loose'' (1687) [http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=29Aug09 The Picket Line]; Robert Wodrow’s ''The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland'' [http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=26Aug09 The Picket Line]</ref> (When the Scottish Presbyterians gained the upper-hand and became the establishment church of Scotland, the tables were turned, and members of dissident churches began to resist taxes paid for its support.<ref>MacLaren, Duncan ''History of the Resistance to the Annuity Tax'' (1836); see also ''[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index5.php?entry=31Aug11 The Picket Line]''.</ref>)

====Resistance in New England, 1687====
On 22 August 1687, [[John Wise (clergyman)|John Wise]] met with some of the other “principal inhabitants” of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich in New England]], and decided that a new tax that had been imposed by governor [[Edmund Andros]], without consulting the colony’s General Assembly, was illegitimate and “that it was not the town’s duty any way to assist that ill method of raising money.” A town meeting the next day that Andros had called for in order to select tax commissioners instead issued a declaration against the tax. A number of those at the town meeting were then arrested, hauled to a jail in another town, and then put on trial before a jury hand-picked by the prosecution and a judge who referred to the defendants as “criminals” over the course of the trial.

Fines and court costs followed, and, at first, the Andros tyranny was triumphant. But Wise and company had the last laugh. On 18 April 1689, in the wake of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in the home country, a “Declaration of the Gentlemen, Merchants, and Inhabitants of Boston” was issued, which proclaimed the assault on the rights of dissenting English colonists to be part of the same plot of “the great Scarlet Whore” to crush Englishmen under the thumb of the papists (that is, [[James II of England]]) again.<ref>''The Andros Tracts'', Vol. I (1868).</ref>

Then followed a revolution. Andros and Judge Dudley, who had tried the case against Wise and the rest, were overthrown and imprisoned (legend has it Andros was caught trying to escape disguised as a woman).

===18th century===

====Camisard revolt, 1700–03====
Tax resistance was a feature of the [[Camisard]] revolt.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 229.</ref>

====New Jersey resistance to a Catholic assessor, 1715====
In 1715, 36 New Jersey residents pledged to refuse to pay taxes “Because wee have been Illegally Assessed by an Asseser who being a Known & open profest Roman Catholick which is Utterly Repugnant to the Laws of Great Brittain & Contrary to ye Rights & Liberties of his Royall Majties faithfull Subjects.” Some of the signers of the pledge were indicted for their refusal.

====18th-century uprisings in Japan====
Successful peasant uprisings in the Fukuyama fief in 1717 (and again in 1752 and 1770), in the Tsuyama fief in 1726–27, and in Iwaki Daira in 1739, focused on the oppressiveness of taxes and tax collection.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 231–35, 241–42.</ref> Other tax revolts in Aizu in 1749, in Shinano Ueda in 1761–63, in Tenma Sodo in 1764–65, in Koyasan in 1776, in Kozuke & Musashi in 1781, and in Hokkaido in 1790, were only partially successful but also led to severe reprisals.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 241–45, 248–49, 279–80, 308–09.</ref>

====Malt tax riots in Scotland, 1725====
A duty on [[malt]] had been imposed in England to pay for a war against France. At the [[Acts of Union 1707|union with Scotland]] in 1707, most taxes were made uniform, but under the Treaty of Union Scotland was given a temporary exemption from the malt tax, until the end of the war. After the war, in 1725, the House of Commons applied a new malt tax which applied throughout Great Britain, but charged at only half the rate in Scotland. Scots were unused to this tax, which increased the price of beer. Enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of their representative in parliament, who had voted for the tax.<ref>Chalmers, George ''Caledonia, or, A historical and topographical account of North Britain'', vol. 2 (1887).</ref>  In Edinburgh, brewers went on strike, illegally.  Much later, in 1806, there were malt tax riots in Llannon, Wales, in which a mob attacked 26 excise tax collectors who were searching for malt.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 322–3.</ref>

====Excise tax riots in England, 1733====
[[Robert Walpole]]’s attempts to introduce an excise tax bill led to widespread, heated protest, including mobs that invaded the House of Commons.  Walpole was forced to withdraw his proposal.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 236–8.</ref>

===="Jack-a-Lents", 1734–49====
In Gloucester and Hereford counties, England, rioters dressed in women's clothing and blackface destroyed tollbooths, a variety of resistance that would reemerge a century later in the Rebecca Riots.<ref>See 
''[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=19Feb10 The Picket Line]'' for some references.</ref> A royal proclamation complained of the rebels that they "have made publick and open Declaration, that they would proceed to pull down ſeveral other Turnpikes; and that if any of the Commiſſioners ſhould attempt to ſet up the Turnpikes again, they would pull down their Houſes, and would cut down the Turnpikes as often as they ſhould be ſet up."<ref>"[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/7316/page/1 By the King, a Proclamation]" ''The [London] Gazette'' 16 July 1734</ref>

A similar outbreak took place in Bristol in 1749, in which self-styled Jack-a-Lents, "many naked with their faces blacked ... destroyed the gates at Bedminster, Ashton, Don John's Cross, Dundry, Backwell, Nailsea, Redcliffe, Totterdown, Teasford and Bath Roads, Hanham, Kingswood, Stoke's Croft, &c., &c."<ref>[http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3089396/ART24 letter-to-the-editor] ''Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian'' 13 January 1849</ref>

====Porteous riots, 1736====
{{main|Porteous Riots}}
Rioters, sympathetic to condemned smugglers who were resisting excise taxes, managed to free one, but in an attempt to free another several were killed by the Edinburgh city guard, commanded by John Porteous.  Porteous was convicted of these killings, but pardoned by Queen Caroline, whereupon a lynch mob seized Porteous and hanged him.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 241.</ref>

====Tithe resistance in France, 1736====
Peasants in disguise attacked and reclaimed the grain from the granary of a tithe collector in France in 1736. Authorities could find no witnesses willing to testify against any of the attackers.<ref name="Scott" />

====North Carolina Counties Resist, 1746====
In 1746, the North Carolina colonial governor tried to rejigger the composition of the colonial Assembly, taking seats away from some counties. Those counties responded by withdrawing from the Assembly and refusing to surrender any taxes to the colonial government. Other counties, not wanting to bear the whole cost of government themselves, then responded by withholding their own taxes. This state of affairs lasted eight years.<ref>Saunders, William L. ''Lessons from our North Carolina Records'' (1888).</ref>

====French and Indian War, 1755====
In the mid-18th century, American [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[John Woolman]] led many Quakers to question and refuse the payment of taxes to pay for the [[French and Indian War]]. In 1755, Woolman addressed the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting with his concern, saying in part:
<blockquote>Some of our members, who are officers in civil government, are, in one case or other, called upon in their respective stations to assist in things relative to the wars; but being in doubt whether to act or crave to be excused from their office, if they see their brethren united in the payment of a tax to carry on the said wars, may think their case not much different, and so might quench the tender movings of the Holy Spirit in their minds.  Thus, by small degrees, we might approach so near to fighting that the distinction would be little else than the name of a peaceable people.<ref>Gummere, A. M.

A group of several like-minded Quakers, including John Woolman, John Churchman, and [[Anthony Benezet]] then sent a letter to other meetings, which read in part:

====The "Regulator" movement, 1767–71====
{{main|War of the Regulation}}
The Regulator movement against the corrupt colonial administration of [[North Carolina]] from around 1767 to 1771 presaged the American Revolution. It began with organized groups of rural North Carolinans refusing to pay inflated taxes to corrupt authorities, and eventually built to an armed rebellion (which was crushed).<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay''.</ref>

====A revolt in Palermo, 1773====
Most Sicilians refused to pay new taxes imposed in 1770, and ripped down notices announcing the new levies. By 1773 the resistance led to a full-fledged revolt and ushered in a period when Palermo was under the ''de facto'' rule of the ''maestranze'' (guilds).<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 271–2.</ref>

====American Revolution====
{{See also|No taxation without representation}}
[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boston Tea Party]], 16 December 1773.]]
British colonists in America used various methods of tax resistance to resist the British in the years leading up to the [[American Revolution]], including the [[Boston Tea Party]] action, the [[Gaspée Affair]], “spinning bees” in which revolutionary-minded women would make untaxed domestic cloth (prefiguring [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]’s homespun cloth campaign), and a boycott of other taxed goods.<ref>Macdonald, Anne ''No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting'' 1988, Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 81–90.</ref>

After the revolution was underway, taxes instituted by the American patriot side were also widely resisted. One 1781 tax in Connecticut, for example, was designed to raise £288,233 but raised only £40,000 due to unwillingness to pay.<ref>Pole, J.R. & Greene, J.P.  ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2003)</ref>  Some Quaker meetings recommended that their members not pay taxes to the revolutionary governments, and other Quakers refused to use Continental currency which the revolutionary governments were using for [[seigniorage]].<ref>Coffin, Linda B. (ed.), ''Handbook on Military Taxes & Conscience'', Friends Committee on War Tax Concerns, 1988, pp. 46+; Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 90–114.</ref>

John Payne, an Englishman who was opposed to the war to suppress the colonial rebellion, went so far as to board up the windows of his home and put his coach out of commission to avoid the taxes on those items, and he rode miles out of his way to avoid toll gates.<ref>''Annals of Smith of Cantley, Balby, and Doncaster, County York''.</ref>

====African American protests against taxation without representation, 1780====
{{main|Paul Cuffe}}
In 1780, [[African American]] [[Paul Cuffe]] and his brother resisted the state tax of Massachusetts.  Cuffe wrote to the state legislature: “While we are not allowed the privilege of free men of the state having no vote or influence in the election with those that tax us. Yet many of our color, as is well known, have cheerfully entered the field of battle in the defense of the common cause.”<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 115–17.</ref> In 1783 free, taxpaying [[African American]]s in Massachusetts were given full citizenship rights, including the right to vote.<ref>[http://www.africanamericans.com/PaulCuffe.htm African Americans - Paul Cuffe]</ref>

====New Hampshire secessionists, 1781====
For a while, during the early days of the United States, Vermont was an independent republic of sorts, though with aspirations for statehood. Some regions of neighboring New Hampshire felt more loyal to the [[Vermont Republic]] than to the confederation of United States, and expressed this by refusing to pay taxes to the latter.

====York tax riot, 1786====
In York, Pennsylvania, in 1786, Jacob Bixler’s cow was distrained after he refused to pay a tax. Sympathizers with Bixler disrupted the subsequent auction and rescued the cow.<ref>Carter, W.

====Tax resistance during the French Revolution====
During the [[French Revolution]] and its aftermath, customs houses were burned by mobs, tax rolls were destroyed, and excise collectors were made to renounce their jobs and then were run out of town (or in some cases killed). Popular tax resistance was directed both against the toppling monarchy and against the governments that would try to replace it.<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 139–53.</ref>

====The Whiskey Rebellion, 1791–94====
{{main|Whiskey Rebellion}}
There was an earlier rebellion, in 1783, against a Pennsylvania state excise tax on whiskey.

====A mass tax strike in Benares, 1810–11====
When the occupation [[British Raj]] attempted to impose a house tax in [[Bengal]], 200,000 residents of [[Benares]] shut their shops, left their homes, assembled ''en masse'' in the countryside, and petitioned the occupation government to lift the tax.  This massing occurred in December 1810–January 1811.  The Raj at first made a show of force, but eventually rescinded the tax.<ref>Wilson, Hayman ''The History of British India, from 1805 to 1835'' (1848).</ref>

====Tax resistance against Charles X of France, 1829====
When [[Charles X of France]] attempted to bypass the legislature and enact its own taxes in 1829, French liberals in the Breton Association organized tax resistance and created a fund to defray the costs of any tax resisters who were prosecuted. Six Parisian newspapers who printed the Association’s manifesto were prosecuted by the crown. Fifteen regional organizations, including ''Refus de l’impôt'', ''[[Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera]]'', and ''Association parisienne'', were formed specifically to engage in tax resistance.<ref>Rader, Daniel L. “The Breton Association and the Press: Propaganda for ‘Legal Resistance’ before the July Revolution” ''French Historical Studies'' 1961; Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 155–60.</ref>

In the 1820s and 1830s, activists like [[William Benbow]] and [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler]] and groups such as the National Union of the Working Classes and National Political Union advocated and practiced tax resistance.<ref>Prothero, Iorwerth “William Benbow and the Concept of the ‘General Strike’” ''Past and Present'', 1974.</ref>

====The Tithe War, 1830–38====
{{main|Tithe War}}
From 1830 to 1838, Irish Catholics conducted a mass tax strike against the mandatory tithes payable to the Anglican official state Church of Ireland. The [[Tithe War]], as it came to be called, had both a nonviolent, passive-resistance wing, led by [[James Warren Doyle]], and a violent one, in which bands of paramilitary secret societies enforced the strike and attacked tax collectors and collaborators. The campaign was eventually successful in eliminating the tithe system, although the government essentially converted what had been tithes on the tenants into rent due through the landlords.

====Resistance in Syria, 1831–54====
Syrians resisted being taxed both by Egypt and later by Turkey, and refused to pay these occupation governments.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 336–7, 345, 359–60.</ref>

====Tax resistance for the Reform Act of 1832====
Tax resistance was an important tool in the arsenal of the [[Birmingham Political Union]] and its allies who forced [[William IV of the United Kingdom|the crown]] and the [[House of Lords]] to capitulate over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]].<ref>Roebuck, John Arthur ''History of the Whig Ministry of 1830, to the Passing of the Reform Bill'' (1852); Jephson, Henry ''The Platform: Its Rise and Progress'' (1892); ''The Annual Register'' (1832); Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 161–67.; “The Non-payment of Taxes.” ''The Sydney Monitor'' 17 October 1832</ref> In the spring of 1832, residents of Carmarthen, Wales, met and vowed to stop paying taxes if the Reform Act were not passed, and some stopped paying taxes in the wake of the collapse of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]]’s government.<ref>Burg (2004), p. 335.</ref>

====U.K. resistance to "Assessed Taxes," 1833–51====
There was sporadic resistance to assessed taxes (particularly the [[window tax]]) in the United Kingdom. Resisters felt the tax was overly-regressive. Resisters formed tax resistance associations and disrupted auctions of goods seized from resisters by the tax authorities.<ref>see, e.g. "[http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000177/18331019/030/0004?browse=false Passive Resistance Associations]" ''Royal Cornwall Gazette'' 19 October 1833; ''The Spectator'' 26 October 1833, 23 November 1833</ref>

====Edinburgh Annuity/Clerico-Police Tax, 1833–61====
An Annuity Tax to raise money for the establishment clergy in Edinburgh, Scotland began to be resisted by nonconformists around 1833, in particular by [[William Tait (publisher)|William Tait]], publisher of ''[[Tait's Magazine|Tait’s Magazine]]'' who went to jail for his stand. Celebrated imprisonments like this, and occasional attempts (often unsuccessful) by the authorities to seize and auction property of the resisters, characterized the campaign. The government attempted to appease the resisters by “abolishing” the Annuity tax, but they did so by paying the clergy from funds raised by a different tax, leading the resisters to dub it the “Clerico-Police Tax” and to continue to resist it.<ref>“[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-august-1833/10/scotland Scotland]” ''The Spectator'' 24 August 1833; “[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/17th-september-1859/14/church-matters-in-edinburgh Church Matters in Edinburgh.]” ''The Spectator'' 17 September 1859</ref>

====Maryland bond protests, 1843====
Some residents of Maryland, as their state government went into default over canal bonds in the wake of the [[Panic of 1837]], refused to pay taxes the proceeds of which were destined for bond-holders. In some areas, tax collectors resigned and the government was unable to find others willing to take their places. Tax resistance was promoted in part by the [[Locofocos]], a Democratic party splinter group.<ref>untitled editorial, [New York] ''Morning Courier'', 8 June 1843.</ref>

===="White Quakers," 1843====
The White Quakers, an Irish Quaker splinter group named for their characteristic undyed clothing, undertook tax resistance in 1843 to protest government harassment of their sect.<ref>See ''[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index5.php?entry=03Oct11 The Picket Line]'' for links to a number of references on the "White Quakers."</ref>

====Mexican-American War, 1846====
{{main|Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)}}
Perhaps the most famous American example of a tax resister, [[Henry David Thoreau]], was briefly jailed in 1846 for refusing to pay taxes in protest against the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]] and the [[Mexican–American War]].  In his essay on [[civil disobedience]], he wrote:
<blockquote>I meet this American government, or its representative, the State government, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in the person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly, Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it, is to deny it then.…<ref>[http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p21 Thoreau, H. D. ''Resistance to Civil Government'']</ref></blockquote>
<blockquote>…If a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.<ref>[http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p22 Thoreau, H.D. ''Resistance to Civil Government'']</ref></blockquote>
Thoreau was following in the footsteps of his fellow New England [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]] who had also been arrested for conscientious refusal to pay the poll tax.

====Karl Marx prosecuted for promoting tax resistance, 1848====
During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], the royal and military aristocracy prohibited the first popularly elected parliament from assembling, and that parliament responded by declaring the government out-of-business:
<blockquote>So long as the National Assembly is not at liberty to continue its sessions in Berlin, the Brandenburg cabinet has no right to dispose of government revenues and to collect taxes.</blockquote>
[[Karl Marx]], via his newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', published this decree, adding: “From today, therefore, taxes are abolished! It is high treason to pay taxes. Refusal to pay taxes is the primary duty of the citizen!”<ref>Marx, Karl “No Tax Payments!” ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' #145 (November 1848), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/17c.htm Marxists.org]</ref>  Marx was later prosecuted for promoting tax resistance, but was acquitted after arguing that it was not illegal to promote tax resistance against an illegal government.<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 239–61.</ref>

====The Great Confederated Anti-Dray and Land Tax League of South Australia, 1850====
The Great Confederated Anti-Dray and Land Tax League of South Australia formed in the Spring of 1850 to resist taxes associated with a recently enacted Road Act. The League felt the taxes were excessive; oppressive to poor farmers while exempting rich merchants, mine owners, and bankers; had been imposed by a non-representative government body; and operated largely for the benefit of land-holders who were also members of the board that was imposing the tax and designing the road system.<ref>“The South Australian Anti-Dray and Land Tax League” ''South Australian Register'' 17 May 1850; “Anti-Dray Tax League” ''South Australian Register'' 5 June 1850, 14 June 1850, 28 June 1850; “The Anti-Dray and Land-Tax League” ''South Australian Register'' 28 September 1850, 19 October 1850; “Anti-Dray & Land Tax League” ''South Australian'' 7 October 1850; “Meeting of the Anti-Dray and Land Tax League” ''South Australian Register'' 20 March 1851</ref>

====Resistance to the Foreign Miners Tax of 1850 in California====
The “Foreign Miners Tax” of 1850 required all California miners who were not American citizens to pay $20 per month. The tax was not so much a revenue raising instrument as a way of allowing citizens to monopolize mining and take over sites being worked by Chinese and Mexican miners. The tax resistance by foreign miners was successful. The tax was repealed by the end of 1850, though a smaller ($4/month) tax was reapplied to Chinese miners in 1852, and some particularly unscrupulous tax collectors continued to extort the tax from foreign miners even when it was no longer legal to do so. One person who was forced off of his mining claim by the Foreign Miners Tax was [[Joaquin Murieta]], whose story became a Robin Hood-like myth in California.

====Prussian democrats, 1850,1864====

In Shantung, tax resisters killed tax collectors and set up parallel government structures.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 360–1.</ref>

====Bhat resistance in India, 1861====
In 1861, travelling bards of the Bhat caste, complaining that they had been traditionally exempt from taxation, reacted to being subjected to an income tax in an extreme demonstration that accompanied their refusal to pay:
:[T]hey cut themselves with knives, cursed the Assessors, bespattering them with their blood, and declared they would rather die than surrender their birthright. When several were apprehended, their wives began to hack their persons, and so severely that several have since died.<ref>“India.” ''South Australian Register'' 15 October 1861</ref>

====Ferenc Deák and Hungarian tax resistance, 1861–67====
Following military defeat by the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] and the subsequent war of independence led by [[Lajos Kossuth]], Hungarians adopted a strategy of [[passive resistance]], including boycotting of Austrian goods and refusing Austrian taxes, while the dissolved Diet (parliament) and various agricultural, trade and educational associations continued to meet informally. The symbol of this strategy was [[Ferenc Deák]], following his refusal to take public office under the Austrians and apparent semi-retirement in the 1850s. After Emperor [[Franz-Joseph]] issued his October Diploma in 1860, granting increased autonomy to various parts of the Austrian empire, the Hungarian county councils and Diet were reconvoked. However, the conflict with Austria continued—including renewed tax resistance—with Deák playing a more active role until the Diet’s demands were conceded in 1867.<ref>Tamás Csapody and Thomas Weber, "Hungarian Nonviolent Resistance Against Austria and Its Place in the History of Nonviolence" in ''Peace and Change'' (2007), vol. 32, no. 4, pp. 499–519; Tamás Csapody, "Secondary Forms of Passive Resistance in Hungary Between 1848 and 1865," ''Central European Political Science Review'' (2004), vol. 5, no. 15, pp. 178–89.</ref>

====Louisiana, 1872–79====
After a disputed election for governor in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]] [[Louisiana]], the losing candidate, [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]], formed a shadow government and declared himself the truly elected governor. As part of this, he issued declarations saying that those people collecting taxes for the actually seated government were acting illegally and illegitimately and that citizens of Louisiana should resist these taxes.

McEnery’s shadow government, representing a [[white supremacy|white-supremacist]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] opposed to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] black and [[carpetbagger]] government, maintained its parallel governance until mid-1873, and then folded under pressure from the United States federal government.<ref>See ''[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=10Sep08 The Picket Line]'' for an overview, including links to contemporary news accounts.

====Launceston, Tasmania, 1874====
The Western Railway was a financial failure, and soon after it went into operation the government had to take it over from its bankrupt owners. Landholders in the railway district felt that the government take-over had changed the relationship between taxpayers and the railway, and that they were “morally exonerated from the principle of local taxation which they had endorsed when the district was polled in 1865. Since that period an entirely new principle had been adopted in the case of the Main Line Railway, and when they hesitated to pay their special rate, they acted on the conviction that it was the Government, and not they, who had broken faith.”<ref>Fenton, James _A History of Tasmania_ (1884)</ref> The landholders launched a tax resistance campaign, forcing the government to capitulate and rescind the tax.

====White miners in Griqualand West, 1874====
In 1874, a group of white, small-scale diamond miners at the “New Rush” in Kimberly, South Africa (then in a British colony called [[Griqualand West]]), launched a tax strike to protest the British colonial government’s lack of response to their grievances.<ref>''Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons Volume'' LII, #11 (Colonies and British Possessions, continued).</ref>

====South Carolina, 1877====
Similarly to what happened in Louisiana, white supremacists in South Carolina who disapproved of the reconstruction government practiced tax resistance<ref>“Political Intelligence: Tax-Payers of South Carolina” ''New York Times'', 8 January 1877.</ref> and discouraged people from loaning money to the government by vowing to repudiate any such debts should they regain power.<ref>“The Debt and Taxation.” ''Charleston Daily News'' 1 April 1871</ref>

====Tax resistance launches the First Boer War, 1880====
The [[First Boer War]] broke out when the British occupation government seized a wagon from Piet Bezuidenhoudt who had refused to pay a tax. When the government attempted to auction off the wagon to raise the tax money, supporters of Bezuidenhoudt seized it, and met government representatives who came after them with armed force.<ref>Russell, A. “The South African Republics” ''Journal of the American Geographical Society'' 1889: “[T]he people of the country adopted an attitude of passive resistance, they refused to pay any taxes or in any way to acknowledge the alien government. In this manner two years passed away, when a change came over the attitude of both parties, the Boers, convinced that mere appeal to England was useless, had determined to take up arms to vindicate their rights, the British Government were becoming dissatisfied that no profits were forthcoming from their new investment. They established a military despotism over the Boers, and when the first attempt was made to enforce the payment of taxes by sending troops to seize on personal property, the first shots were fired which opened the Boer war.”; Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 169–74.</ref>

====Paisley abbey manse tax resistance, 1880====
Paisley instituted a tax to raise funds to repair the manse (minister's house) of Paisley Abbey. People who were not members of that church (the official Church of Scotland) did not feel they should have to pay for this, and in December 1880 they organized a tax resistance campaign. Some 200 people refused to pay the tax. The authorities took legal action against a few, but then quickly dropped the charges.<ref>''The British Friend'', 1 January 1881.</ref>

====Resistance to Repaying Fraudulent Railroad Bonds, 1870–1913====
Crooked politicians and swindlers in Missouri concocted a scheme in which the government issued bonds to pay for a railroad that never got built.

====The Hut Tax War, 1898====
{{main|Hut Tax War of 1898}}
In 1896, the British government decreed that the inland “protectorate” adjacent to its [[Sierra Leone]] colony should be taxed. The tax would be imposed on dwellings, at an annual rate that in some cases exceeded the value of the dwelling itself, and came to be known as the “Hut Tax.”

Natives of the protectorate were unused to regular taxation of any sort, and interpreted the tax as meaning that the British were assuming ownership of all of the dwellings in the area and charging rent.  They were furious at this wholesale appropriation of property, and refused to pay, then adopted armed rebellion when the colonial forces responded with violent reprisals.<ref>Chalmers, David [http://books.google.com/books?id=ycdBAAAAYAAJ “Report By Her Majesty’s Commissioner and Correspondence on the subject of the Insurrection in the Sierra Leone Protectorate, 1898”] (1899).</ref>

====Tancament de Caixes, 1899–1900====
Traders and industrialists in Barcelona, led by mayor Bartomeu Robert i Yarzábal, began a tax strike on 20 October 1899 that came to be known as the "''[[Tancament de Caixes]]''" (shutting the cashboxes). This was a protest to taxes the Spanish government was introducing to pay for the costs of its defeats in the [[Spanish–American War]], and also against tax rates that discriminated against Barcelona in favor of Madrid.

====Foreigners in Japan Resist a Property Tax, 1902====
Starting in Yokohama, and spreading to Kobe and elsewhere, hundreds of British and other foreign residents of Japan resisted a new “House Tax” in the hopes of forcing the legality of the tax into arbitration — passively submitting to distraint rather than paying a tax they felt to be illegal. They were backed (in the demand for arbitration, if not in the tax resistance) by the British, French, and German governments. This became one of the first cases decided by [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|an international tribunal]], with one Japanese judge, one French judge, and a Norwegian judge who turned out to be the tie-breaker, ruling in favor of the Europeans and against Japan.<ref>“Mr. Hellyer and the House Tax” ''The Japan Weekly Mail'' 15 March 1902, p. 296+; “The House Tax” ''The Japan Weekly Mail'' 29 March 1902, p. 334+; “The Value of the Distraint Protests” ''The Japan Weekly Mail'' 19 April 1902, p. 422; “Futility” ''The Japan Weekly Mail'' 19 April 1902, p. 426</ref>

====Cutting off Police Pay-offs in New York City, 1902====
The New York City District Attorney, its Police Commissioner, agents from the Society for the Prevention of Crime, and the president of the New York County Liquor Dealers’ Association in 1902 announced a joint campaign to defend liquor dealers who stopped paying police protection money.<ref>''New York Times'', 8 March 1902.</ref> This mostly represents a government policy change in how it was going to be taxing saloonkeepers, but because the change involved rescinding an extralegal tax extorted under-the-table by city employees, it was hard for the government to accomplish in ordinary ways. So it had to nurture a tax resistance movement and encourage solidarity among its members by offering some protection of its own (including judges who reduced fines against people arrested by the police in extortion attempts to near-nothing).

====British nonconformists, 1903====
In 1903, tens of thousands of British [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]] began resisting the part of their taxes that paid for sectarian schools. Over 170 would eventually be jailed for their tax refusal.<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 291-305.</ref>

====Americans in the Isle of Pines, 1903====
The United States took Cuba from Spain in the [[Spanish–American War]], including the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]]. When Cuba became independent soon after, Americans on the Isle of Pines hoped that they would continue to live under American rule, and they decided to resist paying taxes to Cuba in the hopes of bringing the issue to a head.<ref>"Will Not Pay Taxes", ''New-York Tribune'', 21 January 1903, p. 2</ref>

====Korea, 1903====

====The Russian Revolution, 1905–06====
During the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution of 1905]] a coalition of anti-government groups in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] issued a manifesto calling for mass tax resistance and other economic non-cooperation against Russia’s czarist government. It read, in part, “There is only one way out: to overthrow the government, to deprive it of its last strength. It is necessary to cut the government off from the last source of its existence: financial revenue.”<ref>[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=27Nov05 Manifesto quoted in ''The Picket Line'', 27 November 2005.]</ref>

====The Women's Tax Resistance League, 1909–1918====
{{main|Women's Tax Resistance League}}
The [[women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|British women's suffrage]] movement, in particular the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]], used tax resistance in their struggle, and explicitly saw themselves in a tradition of tax resistance that included [[John Hampden]]. According to one source, "tax resistance proved to be the longest-lived form of militancy, and the most difficult to prosecute."<ref>Nym Mayhall, Laura E. ''The Militant Suffrage Movement: Citizenship and Resistance in Britain, 1860–1930'' [http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=14Dec04 The Picket Line]; Gross, ''We Won't Pay'', pp. 323–25.</ref>

Tax resistance among the [[History of women's suffrage in the United States|American women's suffrage]] movement was less organized, but also practiced. [[Julia Evelina Smith|Julia]] and [[Abby Hadassah Smith|Abby Smith]], [[Anna Howard Shaw|Annie Shaw]], [[Lucy Stone]], [[Virginia Minor]], and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] were among those who practiced and advocated tax resistance as a protest against "taxation without representation."<ref>e.g., Smith, Julia, "Abby Smith and Her Cows"; Gross, ''We Won't Pay'', pp. 325–331.</ref>

Tax resistance also played a role in the women’s suffrage movements of Bermuda, France, Germany, and South Africa.

====World War I in the United States, 1917–18====
In the United States, although the decision of whether or not to purchase war bonds to support [[World War I]] was ostensibly voluntary, those who chose not to buy them were subject to strong pressure including mob violence.<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 313–21.</ref> For example, John Schrag was beaten, arrested, and prosecuted and he and his property were smeared with yellow paint by a mob for having refused to buy war bonds. One witness said:
<blockquote>
[T]hey tried to get him to buy liberty bonds during the war, and he wouldn’t buy none.… They brought him in and he never said a word, and the questions or anything they’d ask him, he never, never complained or never put up no resistance whatsoever. ... I never saw so much yellin’ and a cursing and slapped him. And buffeted him and beat him and kicked him. He never offered any resistance whatsoever. One of the fellows went and got a, a hardware store and got a gallon of yellow paint. And pulled the lid off and poured it over his face. He had a long beard, kind of a short heavyset man, had a nice beard, and that run down all over his eyes, his face, and his beard, and his clothes. Of course that was yellow.… He never offered no resistance whatsoever and they, one man went to the hardware store again and he got a rope and put it around, got there, and put around his neck and marched him down to the, close to the city jail, a little calaboose there. Had a tree there and they was going to hang him to this tree.

...I don’t know how many people walked right up to him and spit in his face and he never said a word. And he just looked up all the time we was doing that. Possibly praying, I don’t know. But there’s some kind of a glow come over his face and he just looked like Christ. ... (inaudible). Enemies smite you on one cheek, turn the other and brother he did it. He just kept doing it.

====Pennsylvania women win the vote, and the tax; Refuse the Second, 1923–27====
When women won the right to vote in the United States, this sometimes also exposed them to taxes they had hitherto been exempt from. Some chose to resist these taxes. In Pennsylvania, a school tax became the target of a massive, state-wide, grassroots resistance campaign. For example:
* In 1923, 89 women in Pottstown said that they were not interested in voting ''or'' in paying taxes, and refused to pay a school tax they had recently become vulnerable to.<ref>“Eighty-Nine Women Refuse to Pay School Tax”, 25 February 1923, ''Reading Eagle''.</ref>
* The same year, 800 women in Haverford refused to pay the tax,<ref>“Haverford Women Must Pay Taxes”, ''Chester Times'', 16 July 1923.</ref> as did 250 in Media.<ref>“School Taxes Must Be Paid” ''Chester Times'', 2 July 1923.</ref>

====Indians in Kenya, 1924====
British citizens of Indian ancestry were in Kenya in such numbers in 1924 that they were beginning to exercise democratic political power. This worried the white ruling class. Britain issued a “white paper” in which it said that paternalistic care for the unenfranchised African natives, rather than the democratic demands of the citizenry would be the priority of the government. Or, in less-euphemistic terms: the white ruling class would rule how it wanted without having to take into account the desires of the Indian voting bloc. Indians responded to this with an organized tax resistance campaign, which led to some of them being imprisoned. Whether from the effect of these imprisonments or from concessions made through back-channel negotiations, the protest ended in a few months. It provided rhetorical ammunition to the Indian independence movement, which used this as an example to show that Britain never intended to offer Indians under its rule equal civil rights.<ref>[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=NA19240227.2.42 “Indians’ Grievances.; Protests in Kenya.; Poll Tax Unpaid.”] Northern Advocate 27 February 1924; [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1924/may/12/indian-subjects-poll-tax “Indian Subjects (Poll Tax)”] (an answer to a question raised in the House of Commons about the tax protest, from Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Meyler, on 12 May 1924)</ref>

====Igbo Women's War, 1929====
The [[Igbo Women's War]] began as a dispute over taxes and a resistance against a census that was being conducted in preparation for taxes. Further tax revolts in 1938 and 1956 grew out of the same movement.

====Indian independence campaign====
{{main|Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha|Salt Satyagraha}}
[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]]’s independence campaign in [[India]] used a variety of tax resistance strategies, including attacking the British taxed [[monopoly|monopolies]] on [[salt]] and [[textile]]s by advocating the illegal production of salt outside of the monopoly system and the home-based spinning of cloth. In 1930 this tax resistance culminated in Gandhi’s famous {{convert|240|mi|km|-1|sing=on}} [[Salt Satyagraha|Salt March to Dandi]] to harvest sea salt in contravention of British law.<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 350–73.</ref> Other tax resistance campaigns persisted after this period, including resistance to the Damodar Canal tax in 1937–9.<ref>Burg (2004), pp. 402–4.</ref>

====The Great Depression, United States====
In the [[United States]], the term "tax revolt" is sometimes used to refer to a series of anti-tax state [[initiative]] campaigns. The first significant wave of these campaigns was during the 1930s. The [[Great Depression]] introduced unprecedented tax burdens to Americans. While real-estate values plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed, the cost of government remained high. As a result, taxes as a percentage of the national income nearly doubled from 11.6 percent in 1929 to 21.1 in 1932. Most of the increase took place at the local level and especially squeezed the resources of real estate taxpayers.  Local tax delinquency rose steadily to a still standing record of 26.3% in 1933.<ref>David T. Beito, ''Taxpayers in Revolt: Tax Resistance during the Great Depression'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1989), pp. 6-7, 15-16-.</ref>

Many Americans reacted to these conditions by forming taxpayers' leagues to call for lower taxes and cuts in government spending. By some estimates, there were three thousand of them by 1933. Taxpayers' leagues endorsed such measures as laws to limit and rollback taxes, lowered penalties on tax delinquents, and cuts in government spending. Partly as a result of their efforts, sixteen states and numerous localities adopted property tax limitations while three states instituted homestead exemptions.<ref>Beito (1989), 15-16-.</ref>

While taxpayers' leagues usually favored traditional legal and political strategies, a few were more direct. Probably the best known of these was the [[Association of Real Estate Taxpayers]] in [[Chicago]]. From 1930 to 1933, it led one of the largest [[tax strike]]s in American history.  At its height, it had 30,000 paid members, a budget of $600,000, and a weekly radio show.<ref>Beito (1989), 60-100.</ref>

By 1933, the taxpayers' leagues had entered a period of decline. Several factors undermined the conditions that had nurtured revolt. For example, economic conditions gradually improved, the federal government extended aid to homeowners, and local governments reduced reliance on real estate taxes. To some extent, the tax revolt also fell victim to an effective counterattack by municipal reformers, government officials, and the holders of municipal debt such as bondholders and bankers who formed so-called "[[Pay Your Taxes]]" campaigns throughout the country. These campaigns used a combination of door-to-door solicitation, threats of coercion, and inducements, such as installment payment plans, to collect back taxes.<ref>Beito (1989), 140-59, 101-29.</ref>

An alternative theory describing the decline of the taxpayers' leagues is that laws limiting existing taxes and new tax revenues from the manufacture and sale of alcohol due to the repeal of [[prohibition]] eliminated the need for the taxpayers' leagues.<ref>[http://mises.org/journals/jls/15_3/15_3_4.pdf THE GREAT DEPRESSION TAX REVOLTS REVISITED Mark Thornton and Chetley Weise]</ref>

====Real Estate Taxpayers, 1931–33, 1977====
{{main|Association of Real Estate Taxpayers}}
During the [[Great Depression]] in the early 1930s, Americans throughout the United States formed thousands of taxpayers’ leagues to protest high property taxes. In some cases, these groups illegally withheld taxes through tax strikes and other forms of resistance. The largest tax strike was in [[Chicago]] and led by the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers. At its height, the Association had more than thirty-thousand dues-paying members.<ref>Beito, David T. ''Taxpayers in Revolt: Tax Resistance during the Great Depression'' (1989).</ref>

<blockquote>I [learned] the principle of voluntary poverty and non payment of taxes… from [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and the [''Catholic Worker'']. When I was working a man asked me "Why does a fellow like you, with an education, and who has been all over the country, end up in this out-of-the-way place working for very little on a farm?" I explained that all people who had good jobs in factories, etc. had a withholding tax for war taken from their pay, and that people who worked on farms had no tax taken from their pay. I told him that I refused to pay taxes. He was a returned soldier and said that he did not like war either, but what could a fellow do about it? I replied that we each did what we really wanted to.<ref>[http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=16Feb06 Hennacy, Ammon, ''The Book of Ammon'', 1994.]</ref></blockquote>

====Poujadism, 1955====
In 1955, a right-wing, anti-tax, middle-class, populist movement led by [[Pierre Poujade]] began resisting taxes in France. The resisters used a variety of tactics, including strikes, harassment of tax collectors, disruption of government auctions, and running for office (several Poujadists were elected to the Chamber of Deputies).<ref>a number of references are linked from ''[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=05Feb10 The Picket Line]''</ref>

====No Taxation Without Representation in D.C., 1955–present====
In 1955 [[District of Columbia]] resident [[Florence Jaffray Harriman]] announced that she would be refusing to pay federal income tax until the federal government enacted “home rule” (a locally elected government) for the District (something the District was not granted until 1973).<ref>“[http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/Gloversville%20NY%20Leader%20Herald/Gloversville%20NY%20Leader%20Herald%201955%20Grayscale/Gloversville%20NY%20Leader%20Herald%201955%20Grayscale%20-%200478.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&u=6790ad31&DocId=17744390&Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&HitCount=4&hits=1b1+1b2+1b3+77b+&SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&.pdf Daisy Harriman Wants Vote For Washingtonians]”, (Gloversville, New York) ''Leader Herald'', 4 May 1955.</ref>

====The Amish gain exemption from social insurance programs in the United States, 1935–65====
In 1965 the [[United States Congress]] allowed the [[Amish]] to be exempt from the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] tax, following a persistent resistance campaign from some Amish who regarded insurance programs as mistrustful of [[God]] and therefore against their religious teachings.<ref>[http://www.amishnews.com/amisharticles/amishss.htm “Pay Unto Caesar — The Amish & Social Security”]</ref> See {{usc|26|3127}} and {{usc|26|1402(g)}} (this exemption also covers [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes).

====Tax resistance in Ethiopia, 1943–68====
There were several outbreaks of armed resistance focused on tax complaints in Ethiopia. In some cases, farmers defaulted on their taxes and abandoned their land rather than pay, some fleeing into neighboring countries. In others, districts refused to elect or admit tax assessors, and used a mix of persuasion and coercion to prevent people from obeying the tax law.<ref>Burg  (2004), pp. 404–7, 409–15.</ref>

====Turks in Cyprus, 1958====
During the struggle over the future of [[Cyprus]] in the late 1950s, Turkish communities refused to pay taxes to Greek-run municipalities.<ref>Benenson, Peter “High Stakes” ''The Spectator'' 13 June 1958</ref>

====Tithe resistance in Malaysia, early 1960s====
In 1960, the Malaysian government converted the traditional Islamic [[zakāt]] (tithe) paid voluntarily by rice farmers into a mandatory tax payable through the government. Opposition to the new government-controlled tithe was, at least in some places, “unanimous and vehement,” and rice farmers developed a number of tactics to resist the tithes, successfully reducing the government’s take to a fraction of what the law allowed.<ref name="Scott">Scott, James C. “Resistance without Protest and without Organization: Peasant Opposition to the Islamic Zakat and the Christian Tithe”, ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', v. 29, #3 (July 1987).</ref>

====A court in the United Kingdom rejects war tax resistance, 1968====
In 1968, in the UK case of ''Cheney v. Conn'', an individual objected to paying a tax that, in part, would be used to procure [[nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]] in unlawful contravention, he contended, of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. His claim was dismissed by the court, the [[judge]] ruling that “What the [taxation] [[statute]] itself enacts cannot be unlawful, because what the statute says and provides is itself the law, and the highest form of law that is known to this country.”<ref>[http://taxnfo.net/tax_protesters.html Tax protesters]</ref>
There remains in the United Kingdom a significant movement of people who wish to withhold the percentage of their taxes used for war and weapons, but instead contribute them into a ring fenced pool for peace-building or peacekeeping purposes. This may be either for religious or economic reasons. See the website [http://www.peacepays.org/ Peace Pays] or the Peace Tax campaign “Conscience,” which produces an alternative tax return form to document the withholding of the military percentage of your taxes (approximately 12% of the total tax bill in the UK).

====Vietnam War, 1968–72====
In early 1968, 448 writers and editors put full-page ads in the ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'', declaring their intention to refuse to pay a proposed 10% [[Vietnam War]] Tax.

(CCH) paragr. 9199 (3d Cir. 1973), ''cert. denied'', 411 U.S. 970 (1973).</ref> That case involved John Paul Malinowski, an instructor in theology at [[St. Joseph’s College in Philadelphia]] and a member of the Philadelphia War Tax Resistance League protesting the use of tax money in the Vietnam War. The taxpayer had filed a false [[Form W-4]], and admitted he knew that he was not legally entitled to claim the exemptions (that is, the allowances) he claimed on the W-4. Malinowski was convicted, and his motion for a new trial or acquittal was denied.

====Efforts to legalize conscientious objection to military taxation, 1972–====
{{main|Conscientious objection to military taxation|National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund|Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act}}
In 1972 United States Congressman [[Ron Dellums]] introduced legislation that would legalize a form of [[conscientious objection to military taxation]], allowing some taxpayers to designate their taxes for non-military spending only. Advocated by [[National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund]], this legislation is regularly reintroduced in the United States Congress and has a number of cosponsors. The legislatures of other countries are also considering similar legislation. Many war tax resisters support this, but others feel that such a law would not actually address the problem that leads them to resist taxation.<ref>Gross, ''We Won’t Pay'', pp. 429–35.</ref>

====Refusing to pay an excise tax on air travel in the U.S., 1972====

====United States, Proposition 13, 1978====
A wave of tax revolts began in the late 1970s and were particularly popular in [[The West (U.S.)|the West]]. In 1978, voters in [[California]] passed [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]], sponsored by [[Howard Jarvis]] and passed overwhelmingly by voters in 1978, which drastically limited [[property tax]] levels in the state.

In subsequent years, the state initiative process, initially championed by [[United States Populist Party|Populists]] and [[progressivism|progressive]]s, has been increasingly used for such purposes by [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[corporation|corporate]] political forces. In the United States, notable examples include a series of initiatives in [[Oregon]] (see [[Oregon tax revolt]]) and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] (see [[Tim Eyman]]), the [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights]] (TABOR) in [[Colorado]], and [[Proposition 2.5|Proposition 2&frac12;]] in [[Massachusetts]].

====Beit Sahour, 1988–89====
{{See also|Beit Sahour#Tax resistance|l1=Tax resistance in Beit Sahour}}
In 1988–89, during the [[First Intifada]], the Palestinian resistance urged people to stop paying taxes to [[Israel]].<ref>Marysdaughter, Karen "Palestinian Tax Resistance Update", ''More than a Paycheck'', April 1997 [http://www.nwtrcc.org/mtap96-97/mtap0497.htm#3 NWTRCC.org]</ref> At the time,  The people of [[Beit Sahour]] responded to this call with an unusually organized and citywide [[tax resistance|tax strike]]. As a result of the tax strike, Israeli military authorities placed the town under curfew for 45 days and seized goods belonging to citizens in raids.

Israel's military forces had the authority, independent from the rest of the Israeli government, to create and enforce taxes in occupied areas. As a result, they would impose taxes on Palestinians as collective punishment measures to discourage the intifada, for instance "the glass tax (for broken windows), the stones tax (for damage done by stones), the missile tax (for Gulf War damage), and a general ''intifada'' tax, among others".<ref>"A Matter of Justice: Tax Resistance in Beit Sahour", ''Nonviolent Sanctions'', Albert Einstein Institution, Spring/Summer 1992.</ref>

====UK Poll Tax, 1989–93====
{{main|Community Charge}}

In 1989-90, the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] reformed local taxation in Britain by replacing [[Rates (tax)|Domestic Rates]] with a new tax known officially as the Community Charge, but more widely and disparagingly known as the "Poll Tax". Whereas Rates had been, at least to some extent, a [[progressive tax]], the Poll Tax was a [[flat tax]] irrespective of income. Many people considered the new tax to be unfair, and a major non-payment campaign saw up to 30% of the population of some council areas refusing to pay. Draconian enforcement measures caused civil unrest, and untimately led to the [[Poll Tax riots]]. The new tax became a major electoral liability for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and was a significant factor in the ousting of Mrs Thatcher by her own party.  Due to its unpopularity and the disastrous impact of non-payment on local authority finances, the tax was replaced by the [[Council Tax]] in 1993.

====Ivory Coast, 2011====
[[Alassane Ouattara]] apparently won the presidential election in [[Ivory Coast]] over incumbent [[Laurent Gbagbo]]. Gbagbo disagreed and refused to leave office. Ouattara then called on the citizens of Ivory Coast to discontinue paying taxes to the Gbagbo government, which eventually was defeated.<ref>“Ivory Coast’s Ouattara Calls for Halt of Tax Payments”, ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 31 January 2011.</ref> When Ouattara took power, however, his government began pursuing those resisters for back taxes.<ref>“Cinq ans après son appel à la désobéissance fiscale: Ouattara lâche les entreprises qui l’ont soutenu” ''Rumeurs d’Abidjan'' 15 January 2014</ref>

In July 2011, the Catalan nationalist group [[Òmnium Cultural]], at its 50th anniversary meeting, called on citizens to redirect their taxes from the central government to a Catalan-run fund until such time as the government concedes more autonomy to the region.<ref>See “[http://www.omnium.cat/ca/noticia/discurs-de-muriel-casals-a-l-acte-de-celebracio-dels-50-anys-d-omnium-cultural-5043.html Discurs de Muriel Casals en l'acte de celebració dels 50 anys d'Òmnium Cultural]” and “[http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20110712/54184805093/los-50-anos-de-omnium-cultural.html Los 50 años de Òmnium cultural]” ''La Vanguardia'' 25 August 2011</ref>

In April, 2012, some Catalan separatists started paying their federal taxes into the Catalan treasury instead of submitting the money to the central Spanish government.<ref>“[http://www.gara.net/paperezkoa/20120413/334205/es/Catalunya-tiene-primeros-ocho-insumisos-fiscales Catalunya ya tiene sus primeros ocho insumisos fiscales]” ''GARA'' 13 April 2012</ref>

====Road Toll Resistance in Argentina, 2011====
Argentine congresswoman Griselda Baldata noticed that nobody was maintaining the road on Route 36, but that the company in charge of maintenance was still collecting a toll. So she stopped paying and urged her constituents to do likewise.<ref>“[http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/polemica-porque-baldata-insto-no-pagar-peaje-ruta-36 Polémica porque Baldata instó a no pagar el peaje en la ruta 36]” ''La Voz'' 3 December 2011</ref>

====Protests against European austerity measures, 2011–15====
In the wake of the [[European sovereign debt crisis]], some governments raised taxes and implemented harsh austerity measures to bring down the government budget deficits and satisfy international creditors. Some people and groups who opposed these measures adopted tax resistance as a protest tactic, for instance in Spain,<ref>“Ejerceremos el derecho de rebelión.

Before the victory of the Greek [[Syriza]] party in the 2015 elections, it had sponsored a “Have Not, Pay Not” tax resistance movement targeting the [[Enfia]] tax. The party’s opposition to this tax was one of the factors in its popularity, and many people stopped paying the tax when it became likely that Syriza would win the elections and do away with the tax entirely.<ref>“[http://www.pelop.gr/?page=article&srv=9&DocID=202846 Κίνημα «Δεν έχω - Δεν πληρώνω ΕΝΦΙΑ» οργανώνει ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ Αχαΐας]” ''Greece'' 3 September 2014; “[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/enfia-tax-greece-new-symbol-austerity-2014130124545458507.html Enfia tax: Greece's new symbol of austerity]” ''Al Jazeera'' 2 February 2014</ref>

====Spanish Autonomists, 2012–14====
Autonomists in Spain, under the banner “''derecho de rebelión''” (right of rebellion), launched a multifaceted tax resistance campaign designed to redirect taxes from the Spanish government (which they felt had overstepped Constitutional bounds and unlawfully usurped power) to locally organized autonomous projects.<ref>See [http://www.derechoderebelion.net/ derechoderebelion.net], ''[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index5.php?entry=22Mar12 ¡Rebelaos!]'', and ''[http://www.derechoderebelion.net/files/2012/03/manual-de-desobediencia-econo%CC%81mica.pdf Manual de Desobediencia Económica]''</ref>

====Salta, Argentina, 2013====
Guillermo Durand Cornejo, president of an argentinian consumer rights organization called CODELCO, and a legislative representative, called on Salteños (citizens of Salta, Argentina) to refuse to pay a municipal tax, in the wake of property tax increases and new taxes in electricity and water bills.

“Until such time as the mayor gives a response to the people concerning the tax hike, I suggest that you do not pay this month’s municipal tax,” he said. “I call for civil disobedience.”

Cornejo said he views a thirty-day tax strike as a wake up call for the government, and suggested that strikers who restrict their strike to a single month will not be subject to government reprisals.<ref>«D.Cornejo: ‹No llamé a la rebelión fiscal solo a un tirón de orejas›» 'El Tribuno' [Salta] 5 February 2013</ref>

====Egypt, 2013====
Egyptian activists are withholding bus and subway fares as a protest against their government’s continuing repression. “We are calling for civil disobedience — not to pay for the metro and buses…” one said. “They’re taking that money and bringing tools to repress us.

====Madagascar, 2013====
Businesses in Madagascar refused to submit taxes to the government, depositing the money in an escrow account instead. The businesses, which represent a large percentage of the country’s tax base, were reacting to a crisis of stability and perceived legitimacy in the government. According to the chair of the Madagascar’s Enterprises Union, “We no longer know with what kind of authorities we should deal at this stage.”<ref>Razafison, Rivonala “Madagascar’s businesses ‘to withhold tax’ over political crisis” ''Africa Review'' 1 June 2013; Razafison, Rivonala “Madagascar businesses ‘withholding tax’ over political crisis” ''Africa Review'' 31 July 2013</ref>

====Tax protesters in Canada====
The [[tax protester]] phenomenon, which had long been part of the national tax scene in the United States, emerged as a difficulty for the Canadian government as well. By 2013, about 400 cases were pending in the Tax Court of Canada — “most using florid and arcane language and claiming bizarre laws that supersede or nullify Canada’s regulations and laws; it prompted the Tax Court to adopt a triage approach to cope with the deluge, grouping cases and directing them to specific judges.”<ref>Humphreys, Adrian “Judges losing patience as anti-government tax-deniers clogging courts with ‘absurd’ claims” ''National Post'' 6 August 2013</ref>

====''Bonnets rouges'' in Brittany, 2013–14====
{{main|Bonnets Rouges}}
In late 2013, a nationalist movement in Brittany called the ''bonnets rouges'' began destroying highway portals that were designed to tax truck transportation in the region. They eventually destroyed hundreds of these portals — as well as the tax office in Morlaix — leading the French government to abandon the tax.<ref>“France delays ‘ecotax’ on road transport after protests” MENAFN 29 October 2013; “Anti-layoff, tax protest in France prompts arson” ''The Nation'' 3 November 2013; Vinocur, Nicholas “France’s Hollande defies Breton tax protest” Reuters, 6 November 2013; Sage, Adam “Lorry spy destroyed in green tax protest” ''London Times'' 6 November 2013; Dupin, Eric “Les bonnets rouges, une révolte postmoderne” ''Slate'' 6 November 2013; “Ecotaxe: les portiques tombent les uns après les autres” ''Le Noucel Observateur'' 3 November 2013; “[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29294096 French Farmers Torch Tax Office in Brittany Protest]” ''BBC News'' 20 September 2014</ref>

====''Pos me salto'' in Mexico, ''passe livre'' in Brazil, and ''Planka.nu'' in Sweden, 2013–14====
{{main|Movimento Passe Livre|Planka.nu}}
When the Mexico city government hiked transit fares by two-thirds, frustrated commuters started leaping the turnstiles, both alone and in organized groups, in a form of protest they call ''pos me salto'' (“well, then, I’ll jump”).<ref>Wilkinson, Tracy & Sanchez, Cecilia “Mexico City subway rate increase enrages commuters” ''Los Angeles Times'' 28 December 2013; “Manifestantes saltan accesos al Metro de la Ciudad de México en protesta por alza de tarifa” ''Wikinoticias'' 11 December 2013</ref>

At around the same time, a similar movement called ''passe livre'' was engaged in similarly motivated actions in Brazil.<ref>Watts, Jonathan “Rio fare protesters seize main station and let commuters travel free” ''The Guardian'' 6 February 2014</ref>

The similar ''Planka.nu'' movement in Sweden went a step further, initiating a mutual insurance plan: For a €12 monthly fee, the plan insures contributors against any tickets they are given for being caught without a ticket — compare this to €100 for a monthly transit pass, or €150 for a fare evasion citation. The plan is running at a profit, taking in about twice as much from subscribers as it has had to pay out in fine reimbursements.<ref>Flegenheimer, Matt “Fare Dodging Is an Organized Rebellion in Stockholm, and It’s Winning” ''New York Times'' 17 May 2014</ref>

====Tunisian taxi drivers, 2014====

====Euromaidan, 2014====
During the [[Euromaidan]] in Ukraine in early 2014, a group of business owners in Lviv announced that they would stop paying value-added and income taxes to the Ukraine central government of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (taxes that went to maintain the military and internal security forces).<ref>“Львівські підприємці відмовилися фінансувати силовиків і апарат Януковича” ''Ukrainian Pravda'' 3 February 2014</ref>

====''"Protesta fiscale ad oltranza"'', 2014====
In northern Italy, a group of small businesses united under the banner "''protesta fiscale ad oltranza''" (tax protest to the bitter end) refuse paying taxes, claiming that the Constitution requires the government to leave them enough to live on and that they should not be forced to borrow money to pay the government.<ref>"Gattinara: Protesta fiscale ad oltranza", ''La Sesia'', 1 February 2014</ref>

For example, when bed and breakfast owner Alessandra Marazzi discovered that fully 84% of what she was bringing in was going to pay taxes and state-monopolized utility fees, she decided to stop paying taxes just so her business (and her family) could survive. Caterer Andrea Polese stopped paying and put a sign on her door reading "I am a tax resister." Bar owner Mariano Pavanello posted a selfie with a sign saying "I decided to stop paying protection money to a state thief.”<ref>Ponziano, di Giorgio "O paghi le tasse oppure chiudi", ''Italia Oggi'', 8 April 2014</ref>

====Venetian independence movement, 2014====
{{main|Venetian independence referendum, 2014}}
After the majority of Venetians who responded to a plebiscite voted to secede from Italy and restore the Venetian Republic, one of the first acts of the organizers of the plebiscite was to decree that the people of Venice were now free from obligations to pay taxes to the Italian state. Gianluca Busato, one of the drivers behind the initiative, went so far as to say that “The payment of taxes to foreign governments [e.g. Italy’s], as well as immoral, it’s illegal.”<ref>“E ora obiezione fiscale: «Ingiusto e immorale pagare le tasse all’Italia»” ''Il Gazzettino'' 26 March 2014; “Plebiscito.eu, delegazione dei Dieci vota ‘l’esenzione fiscale totale’” ''Padova Oggi'' 25 March 2014</ref> The separatists claimed that 3,407 businesses initially signed on to the tax strike, and as many as 93,000 others may be resisting less openly.<ref>“Plebiscito.eu: ‘Sono 93.000 le aziende che fanno obiezione fiscale’” ''l’Independenza'' 17 May 2014</ref>

====Anti-corruption resistance in Austria, 2014====
Some business owners in Austria, notably Wolfgang Reichl and Gerhard Höller, began paying their federal taxes into escrow accounts rather than turning them over to the government, largely in protest over the [[Hypo Group Alpe Adria|Hypo scandal]]. Höller launched a project called [http://www.dersteuerstreik.at/ ''Der Steuerstreik''] ("the tax strike") in an attempt to get more business owners to participate in tax resistance.<ref>"Trafikant im Steuerstreik: 'Es ist höchste Zeit, aufzubegehren'" ''Die Presse'' 8 April 2014; "Viele Skandale und kaum Protestkultur" ''salzburg.orf.at'' 9 April 2014</ref>

Hundreds of vendors at the Wakulima market in [[Nakuru]], Kenya, refused to pay taxes to the county government in June, 2014 in a tax strike to protest the government’s failure to provide the market the sanitation and sewage services the taxes ostensibly pay for.<ref>Wairimu, Irene “Nakuru traders refuse to pay tax over poor service” ''The Star'' 5 June 2014</ref>

====Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, 2014====
In August, 2014, [[Imran Khan]], leader of [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]], a prominent political party in Pakistan, gave a speech in which he called for a "civil disobedience movement" in which "we will not pay taxes, electricity or gas bills," to the central government, in hopes of forcing the resignation of Pakistan's prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]].<ref>"[http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/WOR-we-will-not-pay-taxes-electricity-or-gas-bills-imran-khan-calls-for-civil-disobe-4716360-NOR.html We will not pay taxes, electricity or gas bills: Imran Khan, calls for 'Civil Disobedience Movement']", ''Daily Bhaskar'', 18 August 2014'; "[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-17/khan-tells-pakistan-to-stop-paying-tax-until-sharif-goes Khan Tells Pakistan to Stop Paying Tax Until Sharif Goes]", ''Bloomberg Business'', 18 August 2014</ref>

Khan’s party was in charge of the government in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, and that government itself planned to withhold its federal taxes and utility payments. Asked what they would do if the government responded by cutting off utility service to the province, province Information Minister Mushtaq Ghani said that they would retaliate by cutting off the neighboring province of Punjab from the power generated by the [[Tarbela Dam]], which is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<ref>"[http://www.dawn.com/news/1126093 We’ll stop power supply from Tarbela if centre cuts our electricity: KP minister]", ''Dawn'', 18 August 2014</ref>

====Umbrella Movement, 2014–15====
As Hong Kong’s [[Umbrella Movement]] began to move away from the [[Occupy Central]] mode of street protests, it began to promote tax refusal and refusal to pay rent in government-run housing. Benny Tai Yiu-Ting, one of the movement’s organizers, wrote: “Blocking government may be even more powerful than blocking roads. Refusal to pay taxes, delaying rent payments by tenants in public housing estates and filibustering in the Legislative Council, along with other such acts of noncooperation, could make governing more inconvenient. No government can govern effectively if the majority of its people are unwilling to cooperate.”<ref>“[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hong-kong-protest-leaders-suggest-refusing-pay-taxes-organising-rent-strikes-1478138 Hong Kong protest leaders ready to stop paying taxes and organise rent strikes]” ''International Business Times'' 5 December 2014'; “[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/opinion/benny-tai-on-why-occupy-central-should-end.html?_r=1 What Next for Hong Kong?: Benny Tai on Why Occupy Central Should End]” ''New York Times'' 4 December 2014</ref>
