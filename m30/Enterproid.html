'''Enterproid''' is an [[enterprise mobility management]] software company that helps business customers manage employee-owned smartphones and tablets, a trend known as [[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)]]. Enterproid is best known for its dual-persona platform called Divide, which separates iOS and Android devices into two personas for work and play.

== Product ==

Divide provides a workspace container that encrypts business data and applications and keeps them separate from personal data on an employee's mobile device. Enterproid was one of the first companies to introduce a dual-persona approach for [[enterprise mobility management]] and BYOD. Separating a device into two personas allows companies to protect only the business apps and data without having to manage or restrict the personal use of the device <ref name="technologyreview.com">Simonite, Tom. [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/425741/one-smart-phone-two-personalities "One Smart Phone, Two Personalities"]. "MIT Technology Review." October 13, 2011</ref> Divide, which also includes a number of business apps for email, calendar and contacts, is available for both [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.
