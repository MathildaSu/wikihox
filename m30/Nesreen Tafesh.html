Nesreen comments on her diversified lineage and says:   
“The unique diversity in my genetics made me look at all countries, races and peoples through lenses of affection and compassion. Thus, I broadened my perspectives as to self-elevate and rise above bias against and fundamentalism for any ethnic, ideology or nation. We are all human beings working with the same universe energy pool that God created in us. So I’m an Arabic and Eastern mixture, and this is nice. However, my first and ultimate pertinence is to the humanity wherever it exists.”       
 
Nesreen is the youngest of seven siblings. She moved to the Syrian capital city, Damascus, in 1999 to start her creative journey academically at the High Institute for Theatrical Arts in Damascus. She’s learned from the best instructors at the institute, which is considered one of the most important and established dramatic arts academies in the Arabic world. Among its prominent instructors with renowned names are: Jamal Suliman, Daleh Mamdouh Al-Rahbi, Ghassan Massoud and Fayez Kazak.

==First works==
Nesreen has started her artistic path with big names; after a small experience the first year at the institute with the series Holako directed by Basil Al Khatib, she’s got the golden opportunity to launch her genuine career and actual reputation. It was an occasion to work along with great art makers in the series Rabia Cortoba (Cordoba’s spring.) She played the lead female role with the character of sultan Subeh, wife of Caliph Al-Hakam.)

The work was directed by the renowned Hatem Ali and written by the great writer Dr. Walid Saif. She stood before her then instructor Jamal Suliman playing the Caliph Al-Hakam, and she turned heads with her exquisite performance when she was still a second-year student at the Institute of Theatrical Arts. Since then, she’s been swarmed with offers that took her away temporarily from her studies. She accomplished significant roles and later went back to finish her studies quitting acting for two years. She graduated from the institute in 2008 and resumed her creative journey.

Nesreen Tafesh is considered the first and only Arabic actress to establish a diversified family magazine under her name Nesreen (the white rose); the singular of Nesreen (the white roses.)

The magazine was a hit and distributed in Syria and Lebanon before it stopped at her peak due to the agonized events in Syria. The articles and features triggered enticement and positive energy. She’s meticulously chosen the magazine’s motto based on her belief in women’s causes in the Arabic society. She sensed her role is to awake and encourage women to achieve happiness and success under the slogan (Youthful, Modern and Invigorated.)

In her leading editorial, Nesreen wrote:
Stay always: youthful, modern and invigorated.
Youthful: as you are a free spirit that doesn’t age.
Modern: for you are upbeat and abreast.
Invigorated: as you long for tomorrow carrying love, happiness and peace.

She learned in many professional workshops from the late author Dr Ibrahim Alfiqi, the pioneer in personal development in the Arabic world. So she adores the science of energy, NLP (natural language processing) and spirituality. She immersed herself until she got a certificate from Dr. Ibrahim, who encouraged her to take care of her writing gift.

Nesreen is currently working on a book under self-help genre. It revolves around developing positive energy as a continual objective that she’s started in her magazine to give a helping and loving hand to all women so they can reach happiness, success and inner peace.

She's also Humanitarian Ambassador of The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund or [[PCRF]].<ref>[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/society/nesreen-tafesh-is-humanitarian-ambassador-for-palestinian-fund-1.1323624 Nesreen Tafesh is Humanitarian Ambassador for Palestinian fund]</ref>
