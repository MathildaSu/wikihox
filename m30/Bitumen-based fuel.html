'''Bitumen-based fuel'''  is fuel specifically developed for industrial use. [[Bitumen]] is obtained by [[fractional distillation]] of [[crude oil]]. Bitumen being the heaviest and the fraction with the highest boiling point, appears as the bottom-most fraction.

==Description==
Bitumen is a category of organically-based liquids that are highly [[viscous]], black, and sticky. They are wholly soluble in [[carbon disulfide]]. The world's largest deposit of bitumen is in the [[Orinoco Belt]] in [[Venezuela]].

==Use==
Raw bitumen has an extremely high [[viscosity]], between 8 to 10 API degrees, at ambient temperatures, rendering it unusable for use in electrical power stations. Bitumen can be modified by mixing it with fresh water and a small amount of [[phenol]]-based [[surfactant]]. The resulting mixture has properties similar to conventional fuel oil.

A newer version of bitumen-based fuel has replaced the original version with an [[alcohol]]-based surfactant, making it easier to  transport the fuel and eliminating the health concerns associated with the phenol group of surfactants.

Bitumen-based fuel is currently used as a commercial boiler fuel in power plants in [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Lithuania]], and [[China]]). Commonly available air pollutant control technology can limit emissions from Orimulsion to levels considered [[Best Available Control Technology]], as defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].
