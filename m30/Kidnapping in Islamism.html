[[Islamism|Islamist]] militants, including [[Boko Haram]], [[Hamas]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], have used [[kidnapping]] as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.

===Kidnapping for revenue===

A 2014 investigation by journalist [[Rukmini Maria Callimachi]] published in the [[New York Times]] demonstrated that between 2008 and 2014 Al Qaeda and groups directly affiliated with al-Qaeda took in over   $125 million in from kidnapping, with $66 million of that total paid in 2013 alone.  The article showed that form a somwehat haphazard beginning in 2003, kidnapping grew into the group's main fundraising strategy, with targeted, professional kidnapping of civilians from wealthy European countries - principally France, Spain and Switzerland -  willing to pay huge ransoms.  U.S and U.K. nationals are less commonly targeted since these governments have shown an unwillingness to pay ransom.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Callimachi|first1=Rukmini Maria|title=Paying Ransoms, Europe Bankrolls Qaeda Terror|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/ransoming-citizens-europe-becomes-al-qaedas-patron.html|accessdate=4 September 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>
