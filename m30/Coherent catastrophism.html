[[Victor Clube]] and [[William Napier (astronomer)|Bill Napier]] pioneered '''coherent catastrophism''' in the late 1970s,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Napier and Clube|first=|date=1979|title=A theory of terrestrial catastrophism|url=|journal=Nature|volume=282|pages=455-459|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cosmic Serpent|last=Clube and Napier|first=|publisher=Universe Publishers|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cosmic Winter|last=Clube and Napier|first=|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> although their theory didn't acquire this name until later.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asher, Clube, Napier and Steel|first=|date=1994|title=Coherent Catastrophism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0083665694900027?via%3Dihub|journal=Vistas in Astronomy|volume=38|pages=1-27|via=}}</ref>  The principle of coherent catastrophism has been summarized by Sweatman and Tsikritsis.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Sweatman and Tsikritsis|first=|date=April 2017|title=Decoding Gobekli Tepe with archaeoastronomy: What does the fox say?|url=http://www.maajournal.com/Issues2017a.php|journal=Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry|volume=17|pages=233-250|via=}}</ref>

Briefly, this theory proposes that the Earth is at greater risk of meteoric bombardment and hence catastrophe while a giant comet breaks up in the inner solar system. According to Clube and Napier, the latest episode of coherent catastrophism is caused by the progenitor of comet Encke, a giant comet that entered the inner solar system around 20 to 30 thousand years ago, resulting in the Taurid meteor streams, among others. Although the Taurid meteor stream is currently not thought to be very active, due to precession of the perihelion of this stream's orbit, Earth's orbit is expected to intersect denser regions of this meteor stream four times every roughly 6000 years, hence resulting in a coherent pattern of potential bombardment.

While the origin of the Taurid meteor stream is not disputed, its consequences in terms of any catastrophic encounters has been. This is currently a matter of debate.

Evidence supporting coherent catastrophism is mainly to be found in the scientific astronomical literature.

Since 2007, coherent catastrophism resulting from the Taurid meteor stream, and associated entities, has received support in the form of physical evidence from various earth sciences associated with the [[Younger Dryas impact hypothesis|Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. However,]] this evidence is often disputed, and even accepting the YD impact hypothesis, the nature of the impactor is not established. The impactor has appeared to generate a [[platinum]] layer across the North American continent and Greenland<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petaev, Huang, Jacobsen and Zindler|first=|date=2013|title=Large Pt anomaly in the Greenland ice core points to a cataclysm at the onset of Younger Dryas|url=|journal=PNAS|volume=110, issue 32|pages=12917-12920|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore, et.al.|first=|date=2017|title=Widespread platinum anomaly documented at the Younger-Dryas onset in North American sedimentary sequences|url=|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|pages=44031|via=}}</ref>, but it is not clear whether a platinum signal is consistent wit the [[Taurid]] [[meteor]] stream.

In 2017, coherent catastrophism received further support from researchers from the University of Edinburghâ€™s School of Engineering in the form of evidence from [[Gobekli Tepe]]<ref name=":0" />, although this evidence is disputed by the site's archaeologists<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/|title=The Tepe Telegrams|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>. Sweatman and Tsikritsis<ref name=":0" /> suggest carvings made on stone pillars at Gobekli Tepe can be interpreted as recording the Taurid meteor stream as being responsible for the YD event, and they therefore suggest this evidence supports coherent catastrophism.
