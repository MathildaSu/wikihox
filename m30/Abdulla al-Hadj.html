'''Abdulla al-Hadj''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الله الحاج}}; died 1843) was an [[English people|English]] pirate primarily known for his activity in the [[South China Sea]].  Abdulla was born in [[England]] but was taken to [[Arabia]] while he was still young.  While in Arabia, he converted to [[Islam]] and eventually found his way to [[Murdu]] where he found a job as the rajah's chief advisor. Abdulla was most known for his capture of a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] trading vessel that was stopped at [[Murdu]] in northern Borneo.  While the ship was taking on cargo, Abdulla and a partner boarded the ship and killed the captain and another officer, took over the ship and stripped it bare.  The [[raja]]h of Murdu, hoping to avoid punishment turned Abdulla over to the [[Honourable East India Company]] while keeping the loot for himself.  After a trial, Abdulla was imprisoned for life in [[Bombay]].<ref name="pirates!">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WUGJVMEqRkMC&pg=PA205&ots=ajIA-BE4k6&dq=Jacobszoon+Lucifer&sig=bulFPnY_ndR71mA3adb-tYA1OzE|title=Pirates!: Brigands, Buccaneers, and Privateers in Fact, Fiction, and Legend|accessdate=2007-05-09|last=Rogoziński|first=Jan|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80722-X|year=1995|pages=1}}</ref>
