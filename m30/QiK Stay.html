He has earlier started and successfully exited several ventures like sparehousing.com (an online review and comparison portal for PG accommodations) and ZoZo Stay (an asset-light model for budget hotels available on hourly basis). However, having realized that these profitable businesses weren't scalable, he pivoted the idea to create a chain of co-branded premium budget hotels and launched QiK Stay.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/interview-we-want-to-maintain-a-balance-between-growth-and-profitability-says-jasveer-singh-of-qik-stay-2189792|title=We want to maintain a balance between growth and profitability, says Jasveer Singh of QiK Stay|website=dna|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref>
