== Color of the year ==
Each year since 2010, in the members of Colourlovers have voted in February of each year for their favorite colour created by themselves during the previous year, which is designated as the "Colour Lovers Colour of the Year".  For example, in January 2010, all the colours created in the previous year between February 2009 and January 2010 were voted on to determine which one was the favorite colour of 2010.
  
The results of each year's vote are shown below. So far, there seems to be a predeliction by the members in favor of reddish colors.
