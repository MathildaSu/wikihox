'''Racial transformation''' is the process by which someone changes their appearance with respect to [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], either from their current race to another race or to a new category. These changes are done through a variety of methods including [[surgery]] or chemical treatments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is similar to [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]]; however, it usually entails some physical alterations, rather than merely lying about one's race or using makeup.<ref name="Martin">{{cite book |title= The White African American Body: A Cultural and Literary Exploration |first= Charles D. |last= Martin |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=K4RUy9Hs6lMC&q=Michael+Jackson&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=4#v=snippet&q=Michael%20Jackson&f=false |date= 2002 |isbn= 9780813530321 |page= 163 |quote= The examination of the African man turned white affords [Scully's] partner, Mulder, the opportunity to compare the skin of the victim to another contemporary white Negro.

In the US and Europe, [[sun tanning]] is very popular although tanning has shown many times to be very dangerous and harsh to the skin. However, these are distinct from racial transformation. Subcultures of one race may adopt mannerisms from culture associated with another race, as with "[[wigger]]s", white people who emulate [[African-American culture|African-American cultural]] styling, particularly [[hip-hop]] culture.

[[Skin whitening]], often with harsh and potentially dangerous bleaches, is common in some parts of the world particularly in China, and some parts in Asia, Africa and Jamaica. Skin whitening and hair coloring or straightening may be seen as trying to become white/European. In many cultures such as in Asia's many cultures lighter skin was seen as someone of wealth and who did not have to work in the fields and was also a sign of beauty. Skin lightening had taken place in Asia and various places before the slavery in the U.S.A. and the Americas.

==Plastic surgery==
Some plastic surgery procedures, such as [[Asian blepharoplasty]], a surgical process designed to create an upper eyelid crease in people of [[East Asia]]n descent, or [[rhinoplasty]] to change the appearance of an "ethnic" nose, can also be seen in a racial context. Lip augmentation (lip collagen and lip implants) is a very popular surgical procedure choice of white women, this surgical procedure enlarges the patients lips to a fuller lip size, changing their lips from Caucasian to African American.

==Race choice and transition in pop culture==
Fictional studies of race choice and transformation have often occurred in drama and literature and especially in works of [[science fiction]]. In [[Greg Bear]]'s books ''[[Eon (novel)|Eon]]'' and ''[[Eternity (novel)|Eternity]]'', new human consciousness is created in a [[virtual reality|virtual realm]] and the parents choose the race of their children when it is time for them to be 'birthed' into the real physical world. In this work as well, many humans do not conform to the standard human shape and choose a variety of form and sizes in which to exist both in the physical world and in the virtually.

In an episode of the animated TV show ''[[South Park]]'' entitled [[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] tries out for the basketball team, but is not very good. Wanting to be better, he goes to a plastic surgeon and asks if there is a surgery to make him tall and black. The doctor recommends a "negroplasty" for Kyle. The surgery is done, but Kyle's knees break during the basketball game. The doctor decides to revert him back to his normal white self, for a "small fee".

In another example, the movie ''[[Soul Man (1986)|Soul Man]]'' from 1986 involved race transformation of a white applicant to [[Harvard Law School]]. Unable to pay for tuition, the main character received a scholarship under the pretense of being black.<ref>{{imdb title|0091991|Soul Man}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| author =Janet Maslin| title = Soul Man (1986) Screen: A Comedy 'Soul Man'| quote = There's nothing automatically funny about the story of a rich white college boy who masquerades as black in order to collect a scholarship to Harvard Law School.| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date = October 24, 1986| url =http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE2DB153AF937A15753C1A960948260| accessdate = June 12, 2015}}</ref>

The cast of the [[MTV]] reality TV show [[Jersey Shore (TV series)|''Jersey Shore'']] openly voice their preference for having darker skin/ tanning. They openly discuss their dislike of having light/ pale skin, so they tan themselves to a more ethnic skin color. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} They happen to be "[[Italian people|Italian]]" or portraying the state's large [[Italian American]] community, although most of the personalities, including [[Snooki]] who is [[Chileans|Chilean]] and [[JWoww]] who is Irish and [[Spain|Spanish]], are not of Italian descent.<ref>{{cite news| author =| title =Is the Jersey Shore Cast Really Italian?| quote =| newspaper =[[Wetpaint]]| date = February 23, 2013| url =http://www.wetpaint.com/2013-02-23-is-the-jersey-shore-cast-really-italian/| accessdate = June 12, 2015}}</ref>
