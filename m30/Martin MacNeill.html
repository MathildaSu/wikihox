==Events leading up to the murder==
Michele MacNeill was recovering from cosmetic surgery at the time of her death.

The drugs included Valium, sleeping pills and pain killers.<ref name="NBC News MacNeill guilty of killing wife" />

Prosecutors contended that MacNeill killed his wife so he could be with his mistress, Gypsy Willis. MacNeill hired Willis as a nanny for his youngest children, two weeks after murdering Michele.<ref name="CNN MacNeill found guilty" />

A few of MacNeill's daughters claimed their mother was aware of the affair and had confronted him about it before their mother's death. <ref name="NBC News MacNeill guilty of killing wife" />

During the weeks leading up to the murder MacNeill gave the impression he had contracted a medical condition that required him to walk with a cane.

Martin MacNeill pled not guilty, claiming his wife died due to [[accidental death]].
