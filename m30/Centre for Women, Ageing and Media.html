The '''Centre for Women, Ageing and Media''' (WAM) was established at the University of Gloucestershire in 2007.

A group of academics working at the universities of Gloucestershire, West of England and York (UK) secured Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Networking Grant in order to bring together scholars and practitioners from across the globe to study the relationship between older women as consumers, producers and subjects of popular media. As a result of this successful project a collaborative Centre for Women, Ageing and Media (WAM) was formed at the University of Gloucestershire in 2010.

WAM is a research group consisting of scholars who are working together to explore a range of research themes focusing on older women and popular media forms (digital technologies, film, popular music and television).

Existing academic studies and cultural policy work on ageing are dominated by knowledge created in the areas of healthcare policy, gerontology, economics, social care and sociology. WAM’s aim is both to challenge and enhance this knowledge base.

Taking a broadly feminist and cultural studies approach, WAM aims to position emerging research on older women in relation to popular media/popular culture alongside the more established areas of ageing studies research and, where possible through collaboration, make beneficial interfaces that will lead to more nuanced understandings of the representations, identities and lived experiences of ageing.

WAM are aware that the many public expressions of ageing in the West (such as in a proliferation of representations of old age in the news media and popular media forms such as film and television) are highly instrumental in the formulation of superficial and limited views of ageing and old age (lacking awareness of diversity and in-depth engagements with everyday cultural encounters/experiences). These understandings and representations are also highly instrumental in the formulation of intergenerational misunderstandings and divisions, where flows of knowledge, creativity, emotional and economic resources become popularly conceived of as flowing in one direction only, from young to old.

Current research taking place at the Research Centre questions this model of one directional flow by exploring issues of ageing, intergenerationality, creativity, identities (kinship, individual, community, national and international) in relation not only to representations, but to experiences, practices and also investments in popular cultural forms such as film, music, television and digital forms of media communication such as facebook and Skype.

== The WAM Manifesto ==

'''Colleagues working together as part of WAM’s collaborative research group demand that:'''

1.	The academy and the public sector recognise, address, challenge and refuse misogyny directed at older women in the media and public life

2.	The media should aspire to more diversity in representations of old age than the dominant consumerist notions of ageing for women in public currently do

3.	Issues of class, race, non-normative sexualities and materiality need to be recognised and responded to in relation to older women, both in academic work on representation and in public policy

4.	Older women need to be at the centre of debates to discuss their own identities, their own lives and the policies governing them

5.	Ageing studies need to produce research that explores intergenerationality as means for old and young to work together in their diversities to produce real world outcomes and incremental change

6.	Research on women, ageing and media should be recognised as a form of activism that strives to empower women and older women in particular, by demanding that a wider range of older women should be more visible in all areas of the media and media representation

'''(Launched at the New Dynamics of Ageing event, Ageism and Sexism in the Media, London 13 November 2012)'''

== Summer School ==

The WAM international Summer School is run annually from the University of Gloucestershire at Cheltenham (UK).

This event brings together established academics, early career researchers and post-graduate students from many different institutions, and facilitates discussion based on the themes arising from women, ageing and media studies.

The Summer School offers a challenging and supportive space in which to share ideas or research in progress, and provides a forum for creative enterprise in this area.<ref>http://insight.glos.ac.uk/researchmainpage/ResearchCentres/WAM/SummerSchool/Pages/SummerSchool.aspx</ref>

Themes covered by participants at the various WAM International Summer Schools have so far included: active ageing, stereotypes, temporalities/spatialities, performance, dress, absence, memory, online dating, dance, the mature model, the spinster, LGBT experiences of ageing, popular music and issues of representation.

== The Postgraduate Journal of Women, Ageing and Media (PGWAM) ==

The Postgraduate Journal of Women, Ageing and Media (PGWAM) is a rigorous, peer-reviewed journal which welcomes submissions from postgraduate students and early career researchers working in the fields of ageing studies, media studies, cultural gerontology, and other related disciplines.

Run by postgraduates with support from more experienced academics, the journal aims to make ‘thinking with age’ a key lens from which to approach research focussed on women, ageing and the media (film, television, screen media, popular music, advertising radio and the press).

Submitting work to PGWAM is an important opportunity to be published in a peer-reviewed journal with rigorous academic standards but which also provides an encouraging and supportive space for postgraduates and early career researchers to develop their work and their professional academic skills.<ref>http://insight.glos.ac.uk/researchmainpage/ResearchCentres/WAM/PGWAM/Pages/Contactus.aspx</ref>

The first issue of PGWAM was published in July 2014 and featured articles which explore the ageing body in film noir (Grist, 2014<ref>Grist, Hannah (2014) 'I, Anna (2012) and the Femme Fatale: Neo-noir and Representations of Female Old Age,' in ''PGWAM'' Issue 1, July 2014, pp.5-37</ref>), representations of mature Irish female sexuality on screen (Liddy, 2014<ref>Liddy, Susan (2014) ‘Missing Persons’? Representations of Mature Female Sexuality in British and Irish Film 1998-2011,' in ''PGWAM'' Isssue 1, July 2014, pp.38-66 </ref>), a photographic essay which examined older women in the workplace, and featured event reviews relating to the study of older women. PGWAM accepts rolling submissions year-round, from early career researchers and PhD students.

== Studing Women, Ageing and Media with WAM at the University of Gloucestershire ==

WAM welcomes into its cohort early career researchers, doctoral students, and established academics who might wish to persue a topic relating to the study of women, ageing or media. WAM is an intergenerational, interdisciplinary, cross-cultural group of researchers, who work on a number of topics relating to the ageing woman online, on screen, in print and elsewhere. The University of Gloucestershire (Cheltenham, UK) serves as WAM's UK base, though WAM has Canadian, Scottish, Portugese and other international homes across the world. 

WAM is interested in supervising projects related to film, television, music, print and online media that explores how these are used, understood and remembered along the life-course. WAM is also interested in exploring autoethnographic approaches to research on older women's experiences and memories of popular media forms. The research produced by the WAM research community highlights the skills and perceptions offered by older women that are so often overlooked when designing research.

== AHRC funded Research Networks and Workshops Project ==  

The Women, Ageing and Media (WAM) research group secured an Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) grant (£30k)  in 2007 to run a series of workshops and an international conference in order to conduct a sustained investigation into proliferating print and screen representations of older women. 

With this shared research agenda the research group identified a significant gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between older women as consumers, producers and subjects of media. One of the innovative features of this networking grant is its aim to link academics from different cultural and intellectual backgrounds and to position emerging research on 'older women' in media and cultural studies alongside established research in healthcare policy, gerontology, economics, social care and sociology that dominates existing knowledge.

Each workshop event was designed to involve a mix of newer and more established scholars. The final element was an international conference in December 2008, which brought together the participants of the workshops with a selection of internationa scholars. <ref>http://insight.glos.ac.uk/researchmainpage/ResearchCentres/WAM/Pages/AHRCfundedResearchNetworksandWorkshopsProject.aspx</ref>
