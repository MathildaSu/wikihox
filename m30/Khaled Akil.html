'''Khaled Akil''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''خالد عقيل''') is a Syrian [[Fine-art photographer]], work focuses primarily on social and political issues in the Middle East. Khaled Akil was born in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], where his family has a long history. He is son of established painter Youssef Akil, His great maternal grandfather is the Syrian author [[Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi]],

He has a bachelor's degree in law and political science, which has enabled him to do his artistic investigations in the context of the social issues that he observes on a daily basis. He has spent much of the current Syrian war in Aleppo. He is currently working on a temporary basis in Istanbul.

== Technic ==

His work is a hybrid of photography and painting, with a digital final product. It is made up of layers of ancient Arabic scripts and symbols done by himself that have a direct relation with the photographic work and the societal problem he is trying to describe.

Khaled Akil subjects his original photographs to countless layers of manual intervention that ultimately result in digital prints. With their mixture of photography, painting, and Arabic calligraphy, the dense surfaces of the works make them seem like engravings on ancient stone.

== Series ==

===The Unmentioned - 2011===

The story behind the photographs in the Unmentioned series is the Khaled Akil's  life, the story of Syria, and simply put, the story of all the countries in the Middle East.

Three things are behind the war, and the complicated times in Syria and the Middle east: religion, sex, and politics.

The Unmentioned is a blatant ‘NO’ to the war in Syria, and the dictatorship in the region. Khaled began working on the pieces in 2009, way before the conflict began in Syria, as he felt that the way were living would eventually result in the Syrian chaos.

That is why Akil tried to raise some awareness among Syrians, by focusing on the real problems they should be aware of, so that the revolution wouldn’t take on a religious aspect, and more specifically, an extremist one.

===The Legend of Death - 2013===

Legend of Death is Syrian artist Khaled Akil’s visual journey through Syria and his native Aleppo, one of the world’s earliest settlements. The work unfolds as a dreamlike paradox in which the ephemeral and the permanent overlap, coming together on the edge of beauty and tragedy.

What one sees when looking into these images is a dual universe wherein creatures and symbols from the ancient world merge with the visual fragments of war and abandonment. As the 5,000-year-old land of Syria experiences one of its darkest periods, with its cultural heritage being dismantled and destroyed, Khaled Akil’s work presents a reminder that empires rise and fall, and conquerors come and go, but the Mesopotamia of 1000-900 BCE remains, a land that is fertile with the symbols and forms of civilization.

These works were produced in the middle of the Syrian war, during the battles of Aleppo 2012. Khaled Akil subjects his original photographs to countless layers of manual intervention that ultimately result in digital prints. With their mixture of photography, painting, and Arabic calligraphy, the dense surfaces of the works make them seem like engravings on ancient stone, once preserved, but now destroyed by war. With them, the artist creates a tribute to an ageless Syria that has existed through millennia of history.
