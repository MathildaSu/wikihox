'''Element Electronics''' is an American-owned producer of flat panel televisions.

== History ==
Element began producing flat panel TVs in March 2012 in a factory in Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/02/made-in-america/index.htm|title=Products Made in America - Consumer Reports Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref> The company opened a second plant in South Carolina, which is estimated to bring 500 jobs to the area over a period of five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-10/whats-new-in-television-more-tv-sets-are-being-made-in-the-u-dot-s-dot-a|title=What's New in Television? More TV Sets Are Being Made in the U.S.|author=Harold L. Sirkin|date=10 January 2014|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref> The brand is carried by Walmart, Target, and other retailers.<ref>http://www.tribtoday.com/page/content.detail/id/592255.html</ref>

In 2014, a group called Alliance for American Manufacturing claimed that Element televisions were not made in the United States <ref>https://thinkprogress.org/walmarts-made-in-usa-televisions-are-allegedly-made-in-china-ebf3ae7cceec</ref>. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] followed up with Element for clarification, and decided not to pursue an investigation after "the Company
made changes to its website to clarify that some - not all - of Element's televisions are assembled in the United States".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ensor|first1=Julia|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/closing_letters/made-usa/150507elementelectronicsletter.pdf|title=Element Electronics letter|publisher=US Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=3 December 2016|date=7 May 2015}}</ref>
