'''''Canadian Voices''''' is a public affairs radio series produced by [[CJLY-FM]] (Kootenay Cooperative Radio), a volunteer-run [[non-profit]] community radio station in [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

Through a series of one-hour audio programmes, ''Canadian Voices'' presents [[radio]], [[internet]], and [[Media player (application software)|media player]] listeners with the opportunity to hear talks by Canadian authors, academics, activists, artists, and thought-provoking citizens who explore ideas and events that characterize the political left in Canada. Topics range from [[human rights]], [[climate change]], and media analysis, to [[food security]], [[art]], [[education]] and [[spirituality]].

''Canadian Voices'' is coordinated by Zoë Creighton, with input and assistance from volunteers across the country. The series is distinct from much public and current affairs radio programming, as each featured speakers is a Canadian, the series is produced in Canada, by Canadians, and it focuses on topics that are of interest to Canadians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianvoices.org/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807123136/http://www.canadianvoices.org/about.php |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }} About Canadian Voices</ref>
