The company was founded in 1992 by Paul Odom. Odom started his career in the food and beverage industry, working for [[Coca-Cola]] and also Frito-lay. After meeting [[roaster]] Steve Smith in 1991, he decided to develop the startup Fonte Coffee a year later.

The [[Boston Herald]] reported in 2003 about the unique approach the company took in roasting coffee beans for its customers. The company had begun taking orders via the phone and also the [[Internet]]. It was reported that once an order had been placed, the senior roaster Smith would personally roast the coffee beans for each client.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Exum|first1=David|title=Fonté Coffee offers individual attention|publisher=[[Boston Herald]]|date=December 3, 2003}}</ref> In 2004, the company began roasting a unique [[Ethiopia]]n blend of coffee.
