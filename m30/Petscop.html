Petscop is an fictional unfinished game that was created for the original [[PlayStation]], by fictional Developer Garalina, supposedly in 1997. The only content of the game is a series of 10 videos uploaded to [[YouTube|youtube]] on the channel Petscop. The game is likely fictional, created for the sole purpose of the videos and sharing the story of [[Candace Newmaker]], the leading theory about the meaning of the videos and game. The person, who is presumably male, named his character Paul when starting the game and the name has been adopted as the name of the protagonist by most theorists and websites. 

== Theories ==

=== The Candace Newmaker theory ===
This is the theory with the most evidence and traction. Candace Newmaker was a girl, who, at the age of 10, died from [[Asphyxia|asphyxiation]] after being suffocated inside a blanket with the weight of 4 adults on top of her. The event is referenced throughout Petscop, with the term rebirthing being used multiple times in the game. Other evidence such as the way things are described in the only "completed" level in the game, the gift plane, relate to how Jeane Newmaker adopted Candace. The prime example is the way the game tells you to show the pets you are trying to catch that there is nothing to be afraid of, yet to catch many of them you need to trick the pets to capture them.
