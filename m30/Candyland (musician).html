'''Josie Martin''' (born December 17, 1988) better known by her stage name '''Candyland''', is an [[Americans|American]] record producer, DJ and musician.<ref>{{URL|facebook.com/candylanddjs}}</ref>

Candyland has been more commonly known as a duo consisting of both Martin and Ethan Davis. But in 2014, Ethan Davis officially left the project, therefore transforming Candyland into a solo act, now carried by Martin alone.<ref>http://www.youredm.com/2015/04/08/ladies-on-deck-candyland/</ref>

==Early life and beginnings==

Josie Martin was born on 17 December 1990 in [[Santa Barbara, California]].<ref>http://thedjlist.com/djs/candyland/info/</ref> When she was an infant, she was taken and placed in an infant homeless shelter. This was because her parents were homeless, and unsuitable for
the child; with Josie Martin's father being a drug dealer and Martin's mother being a drug abuser who had multiple personality disorder and consistently heard voices.<ref>https://m.facebook.com/CandylandDJs/photos/a.225704964126803.62427.183277045036262/1069422456421712/?type=3&source=48&__tn__=E</ref> While at the infant homeless shelter, Martin was adopted by a twenty-two year old girl who was working there at the time.<ref>https://m.facebook.com/CandylandDJs/photos/a.225704964126803.62427.183277045036262/1069422456421712/?type=3&source=48&__tn__=E</ref>

As Martin grew up, alongside her younger step-brother, she became very passionate about [[basketball]], and intended on having a career as a basketball player. Though unfortunately, during a summer game in high school, she broke her knee. Subsequently, Martin's plans for basketball had been crushed; and after a short period of depression and confusion, at the age of 16, Martin decided to embark on a musical career as a DJ instead.<ref>https://m.facebook.com/CandylandDJs/photos/a.225704964126803.62427.183277045036262/1223616114335678/?type=3&source=48&__tn__=E</ref>

Josie Martin's first gig was at Ethan Davis' 17th birthday party, which is where the two met.<ref>http://dancemusicnw.com/candyland-interview-josie-martin/</ref> From thereon, they decided to collaborate as a duo. A year passed before the duo's first song or official name was created though.
{{quotation|When we started we had no intention of making our own music. We were DJing probably about a year before the scene really started to take off. Everyone in town would only let their friends DJ all the good house parties so we decided to just start making our own music so people would ASK us to play.|Candyland (as a duo)<ref>http://electricsloth.com/2013/04/interview-candyland-2/</ref>}}
Soon after, the duo were in search of a name that people could "chant at." In the process, Davis conceived the idea of Candyland; with Martin later commenting that the name "had a good fit" during a recent interview.<ref>https://peoplewithcooljobs.com/2015/10/12/josie-martin-candyland-dj/</ref>

Candyland's first original track was signed by [[Lazy Rich]] via [[Lazy Rich|Big Fish Recordings]] in 2011.
