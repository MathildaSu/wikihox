== Strangers ==

Lea Thau's podcast, ''Strangers'', describes itself as "an empathy shot in your arm, featuring true stories about the people we meet, the connections we make, the heartbreaks we suffer, the kindnesses we encounter, and those frightful moments when we discover that WE aren't even who we thought we were." <ref>https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/strangers/id490297492?mt=2</ref> Strangers started in conjunction with [[KCRW]]'s Independent Producer Project and is now part of PRX's Radiotopia collective.

== Love Hurts ==

One of the most popular Strangers series is the "''Love Hurts''" series, which chronicles Thau's deeply personal exploration of why she's still single, four years after her fiance left her when she was eight months pregnant. The third episode in the series, "Love Hurts 3," was named by [[Slate Magazine]] as one of "The Top 25 Best Podcast Episodes Ever."<ref>http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/ten_years_in_your_ears/2014/12/best_podcast_episodes_ever_the_25_best_from_serial_to_the_ricky_gervais.single.html</ref>
