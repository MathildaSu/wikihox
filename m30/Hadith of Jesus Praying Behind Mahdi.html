'''Hadith of Jesus Praying Behind Mahdi''' ({{lang-fa|حدیث نماز خواندن عیسی به امامت مهدی}}) refers to a collection of narrations related about the prophecy that "[[Jesus]]" will follow [[Mahdi]]'s lead in ''[[salat]]'' ("prayer") after he descends. Mahdi is the twelfth Imam of the [[Shia muslims]] and salat is the Islamic practice of worship of [[God]] which muslims perform five times a day. The prophecy is narrated in numerous hadith collections. A total of 29 Hadiths relate the return of Jesus, and his prayer with Mahdi's lead.<ref name= "Yahya">{{cite book |last= [[Adnan Oktar|Harun Yahya]] |DUPLICATE_date=  |title= The Prophet Jesus (as) and Hazrat Mahdi (as) Will Come This Century |url= http://fs.fmanager.net/files/flashpages/index.php?bookid=27681| publisher= GLOBAL PUBLISHING| date= July 2010|edition=First| location= Turkey|accessdate= 9 June 2014}}</ref>

[[Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi|Allamah Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi]] quotes the above tradition in his book "Muhammad (S) is the Last Prophet" and concludes:{{quote|This refers to the fact that Prophet Jesus (a.s.) will not lead in the prayer, but the Imam of the Muslims who will leading them will lead in the prayers, and Prophet Jesus will follow him.<ref>{{cite book |last= [[Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi|Allamah Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi]] |date=  |title= Muhammad (S) is the Last Prophet |url= http://www.al-islam.org/muhammad-the-last-prophet-sayyid-akhtar-rizvi/jesus-son-mary|location= Islamic Republic of Iran| publisher= Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania|accessdate= 9 June 2014}}</ref>}}

{{QuoteHadith|Jabir ibn Abd Allah|matn=This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir Ibn Abdillah al-Ansari that I heard the Messenger of Allah saying: "A group of my Ummah will fight for the truth until near the day of judgment when Jesus, the son of Marry, will descend, and the leader of them will ask him to lead the prayer, but Jesus declines, saying: "No, Verily, among you Allah has made leaders for others and He has bestowed his bounty upon them."<ref>{{cite book |title = [[Sahih Muslim]] |language = Arabic| page =193, part2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title = [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] |language = Arabic| volume = vol. 3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = [[Al-Suyuti|Jalaluddin al-Suyuti]]|title = Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman |language = Arabic| page= 57}}</ref>}}

Abu Ya’ala provides another version of this hadith in his [[Hadith terminology|musnad]] with more clear terms. {{QuoteHadith|Jabir ibn Abd Allah|matn=This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir Ibn Abdillah al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah said: "A group among my Ummah will continue to fight for the truth until Jesus, the son of Marry, will descend, and the Imam of them will ask him to lead the prayer, but Jesus replies: "You have more right to it, and verily Allah has honored some of you over others in this Ummah." <ref>Musnad by Abu Ya'la</ref>}}

{{QuoteHadith|Al-Husayn Al-Ajiri |matn= The traditions of al-Mustafa (S) on the rising of al-Mahdi has been transmitted via numerous authorities and is more than the level of (being sufficient for) Mutawatir, describing that he is of his Ahlul-Bayt, and will fill the earth with justice, and that Jesus (as) will come at the same time and he will assist Jesus for killing al-Dajjal in the land of Palestine, and that he will lead this nation and Jesus will pray behind him.<ref>{{cite book| last= [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]]| title= [[Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah]]| page=254, Ch. 11, section 1}}</ref> }}

{{QuoteHadith|Sa'id ibn Jubayr|matn= It is narrated from Ibne Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (a.s) said, “My Caliphs and successors are twelve persons, first of whom is my brother and the last my great grandson.” He was asked, “O Allah’s Messenger! Who is your brothera” He replied, “Ali bin Abi Talib.” He was asked, “Who is your great grandsona” He replied, “Mahdi, who shall fill the earth with justice and equity like it would be fraught with injustice and oppression. By the One in Whose hands is my life! Even if a day remains for the earth, the Almighty Allah will prolong this day till my son, Mahdi reappears and Isa bin Maryam descends to the earth and recites prayer behind His Eminence. The earth shall be illuminated from the east to the west.<ref>{{cite book| title=[[Fara'id al-Simtayn]] | page= 43}}</ref>}}

==Interpretation==
Jesus and Mahdi will be both present at the same time and it is said that the leaders who take commands are from [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]], then Jesus will be the [[Vizier]] of Mahdi. That's why he will perform the prayer behind Mahdi and follow him.<ref name= "Yahya" /> [[Al-Suyuti|Jalaluddin al-Suyuti]] writes in his [[Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman]]<ref>{{cite book| title=Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman | last= [[Al-Suyuti|Jalaluddin al-Suyuti]] | page= 56}}</ref> that:
{{quote|I have heard some of the deniers of (truth) deny what has been conveyed about Jesus that when he descends will pray the Fajr prayer behind al-Mahdi. They say, Jesus has higher status than to pray behind a non-Prophet.
This is a bizarre opinion since the issue of prayer of Jesus behind al-Mahdi has been proven strongly via numerous authentic traditions from the Messenger of Allah, who is the most truthful.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project Team |date=  |title= A Shi'ite Encyclopedia |url= http://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team|location= Islamic Republic of Iran|accessdate= 9 June 2014}}</ref>}}
