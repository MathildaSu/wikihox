== Career ==
In 2012, Sejeong participated in the second season of competition television show ''[[K-pop Star 2]]'', at the age of 17.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stoo.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2016021308402015140|title=프로듀스101 순위1위 김세정, 3년전 'K팝스타2' 시절 어땠나|website=stoo.asiae.co.kr|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> She did not make it through the second round ranking audition, but [[Yang Hyun-suk]] (YG) brought her back with a wildcard for the casting round where she performed a duet of [[Taeyang]]'s "I Need A Girl" with fellow contestant Jo Yoo Min.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/01/06/2013010600996.html|title='K팝스타2' 조윤민·김세정, YG 동반 캐스팅..'깜짝'|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> YG cast the both of them, grouping Sejeong with contestants Nicole Curry and Lee Soo Kyung for the final casting round. At the end of the round, though, she was not cast by [[YG Entertainment]], [[JYP Entertainment]] or [[SM Entertainment]] and was eliminated from the competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.tf.co.kr/read/entertain/1131433.htm|title='케이팝 스타2' YG표 걸그룹, 혹평 속 니콜 커리만 YG행|last=tf.co.kr|language=ko-KR|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>

In January 2016, Sejeong, together with fellow trainees Kim Na-young and Kang Mi-na, represented [[Jellyfish Entertainment]] on reality girl group survival show ''[[Produce 101]]'' for the chance to debut in a Mnet girl group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreaboo.com/trending/netizens-claim-jellyfishs-amazing-eye-for-trainee-talent-promises-a-bright-future/|title=Netizens Claim Jellyfish's AMAZING Eye For Trainee Talent Promises A BRIGHT Future – Koreaboo|date=2016-02-17|website=Koreaboo|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref>

All three of them were assigned to "Group A" in the first episode of the program, indicating a high level of weekly poll support, and maintained their high popularity rankings throughout the show. Sejeong achieved the first-place ranking on several episodes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/03/12/2016031200071.html|title='프로듀스101' 김세정 1위 지켰다…2위 최유정·3위 강미나|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/BestClick/3/all/20160220/76553546/1|title=프로듀스 101 김세정 1위, 눈물 소감…최고 시청률 경신|website=news.donga.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> earning the title 'God Sejeong', which has become her nickname.
