'''Gene Smith''' was a member of the [[Memphis Mafia]] as well as being a life-long friend and cousin of [[Elvis Presley]]. He is often cited in Elvis conspiracy theories.

==Early life==
Gene Smith was the son of William Edward Smith and Levalle Smith (Smith being both her [[maiden name]] and married name). Gene's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix: on his mother's side, he was [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], with some [[Normans|French Norman]]; one of Levalle's great-great-grandmothers was [[Cherokee]].<ref name=Dundy1>{{cite book|last1=Dundy|first1=Elaine|title=Elvis and Gladys (Southern Icons)|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|pages=13, 16, 20–22, 26|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> Levalle was the sister of Gladys Smith Presley, Elvis' mother.<ref name=Nash1>{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=Alanna|title=Elvis and the Memphis Mafia|date=2012|publisher=Aurum Press|isbn=9781845137595|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7jDBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT192&lpg=PT192&dq=junior+smith+and+elvis+cousin&source=bl&ots=Ru9ft24eCf&sig=O8uRWbpO1PH8ebQizWmrvpPsAKw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ELEoVL_2Mc-coQST0IKYAQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=gene%20smith&f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref> The family was poor enough that Gene dropped out of high school to help support them and took a job at Hall's Grocery as a bicycle delivery boy.<ref name=Hazen1>{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Cindy|title=Memphis Elvis-Style|date=1997|publisher=John F.

==Adult life==

===With Elvis===
Smith and Elvis grew up together before the latter was famous, having been born only seven weeks apart. They had a "close friendship" that lasted until 1962, when a misunderstanding had them part ways. Eventually, however, Smith would visit Elvis at Graceland.<ref name=elvisaus1>{{cite news|title=Elvis Presley and the Memphis Mafia|url=http://memphismafia.elvis.com.au/|accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=Elvis Australia}}</ref> Before Elvis started singing professionally, the two worked together at Precision Tool.<ref name=interview1>{{cite news|title=INTERVIEW WITH BILLY SMITH - 12 FEBRUARY 2006|url=http://www.elvis100percent.com/interview120206.htm|accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=Elvis 100%|date=12 Feb 2006}}</ref> After Elvis was popular, however, Smith became a part of the Memphis Mafia and ended up on Elvis' payroll and often traveled with him. One of the roles that Smith performed was that of chauffeur.<ref name=Elvicities1>{{cite web|title=ELVIS' FRIENDS|url=http://www.elvicities.com/~myboymyboy/friends.html|website=Elvicities|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref> [[Jerry Schilling]] also recounts that Smith acted as gatekeeper to Elvis once many people were clamoring for his attention. Smith adopted a "more businesslike appearance" and vetted those that were trying to get access to Elvis.<ref name=Schilling1>{{cite book|last1=Schilling|first1=Jerry|title=Me and a Guy Named Elvis: My Lifelong Friendship with Elvis Presley|date=2006|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781592402311|page=50|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DjNNT8kiwpgC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=gene+smith+elvis+cousin+in+jailhouse+rock&source=bl&ots=BSw8eLWQ2o&sig=Nzk8t7f0Ytq0iWte-Ed1EwhMWdo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S6QoVJiuJ4vioATF64KQCA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=gene%20smith%20elvis%20cousin%20in%20jailhouse%20rock&f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref>

The two were close enough that [[George Klein (disc jockey)|George Klein]] describes their relationship as "so close they had their own private language together that was almost impossible for anyone else to make sense of. Gene wasn't book smart, but he was funny, easygoing and was one of those one of a kind characters Elvis always seemed to enjoy."<ref name="Klein 1">{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=George|title=Elvis: My Best Man: Radio Days, Rock 'n' Roll Nights, and My Lifelong Friendship with Elvis Presley|date=2011|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=9780307452757|page=54|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HvfQid71l-QC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=elvis+cousin+gene+smith&source=bl&ots=OTtoa6Qqcp&sig=Hb3pYVxiB1zVboKt2j3GncpA6v0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9aAoVLfSNdCRoQT2vYH4CA&ved=0CEsQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&q=elvis%20cousin%20gene%20smith&f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref>

===Marriage===
Smith met his wife Louise at a clothing store that she and her mother worked at. Elvis and Smith came in to the store, and both men signed up for credit accounts. Eventually, this led to Smith courting Louise, and when he would pick her up for a date Elvis would also be in tow. Louise recalls they had "no money", and would often find their own entertainment. Eventually the two were "happily married" for 43 years.<ref name=McDowell1>{{cite book|last1=McDowell|first1=Ronnie|title=Genuine Elvis, The: Photos and Untold Stories about the King|date=2009|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1589806955|pages=13–14|url=http://www.pelicanpub.com/content/9781589806955_ch%201.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>

==Elvis conspiracy theories==
{{Portal|Elvis Presley}}
Smith had a conversation with [[Gail Brewer-Giorgio]] that she recorded in which he posits the body in Elvis' coffin at his funeral was not actually Elvis. Smith stated that the body in the coffin could have been made of wax, and that "those weren't Elvis' hands" and that his sideburns were glued on. Brewer-Giorgio uses this conversation as further evidence that Elvis is actually alive and well, and that his death was an elaborate hoax.<ref name=Reece1>{{cite book|last1=Reece|first1=Gregory L.|title=Elvis Religion: The Cult of the King|date=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781845112561|pages=159–160|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VNDyks01EkkC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=elvis+cousin+gene+smith&source=bl&ots=66-x_PT-oo&sig=ZF1deLKVEDDk_zK6hQ4c382PrZU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=opgoVK_jIdDhoAS3-IKADQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=elvis%20cousin%20gene%20smith&f=false|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>

Smith's claims were widely circulated in the media, and Smith wrote a letter to Adam Vaughn in which he also states that the nose on the body in the coffin was too flat to be Elvis' nose. While the medical coroner reported Elvis fell onto his face and broke his nose, Smith maintained that the body was not Elvis'.<ref name=Marcel1>{{cite book|last1=Marcel|first1=Glen|title=Chasing Elvis|date=2004|publisher=The Invisible College Press, LLC,|isbn=9781931468206|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CPa23-LJDaEC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=elvis+cousin+gene+smith&source=bl&ots=2aeFHbP12V&sig=WsRySP3F-4Y_FD1oAPbdxSkInus&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6p0oVL-yK4bdoATbuYDYAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=elvis%20cousin%20gene%20smith&f=false|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>
