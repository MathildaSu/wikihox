==History==
Inspired by [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson’s]] emotional memorial, Brooks and Lawrence produced their first flash mob in July 2009 when they recreated Sweden’s “[[Beat It]]” flash mob. They next produced a flash mob honoring the late pop star on what would have been his 51st birthday, which caught the attention of [[Universal Music Group]], who in turn hired them to produce a flash mob for Michael’s sister [[Janet Jackson]].<ref name="Flash Mob America Creates Joy Through Surprise"/><ref name="Janet Jackson Surprises Fans At Flash Mob In Los Angeles">{{cite web
