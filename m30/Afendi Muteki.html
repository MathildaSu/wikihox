'''Afendi Muteki''' (written in Oromo as Afandii Muttaqii: in Ge’ez አፈንዲ ሙተቂ) is an Ethiopian writer and blogger noted for his ethnographic and historical articles. Born in Gelemso town of West Harerghe Zone on April 10, 1978, he studied economics at Addis Ababa University. In recent years, however, he turned his face to writing. His articles mainly focus on eastern Ethiopia.<ref>[http://afendimutekiharar.blogspot.com.html አፈንዲ ሙተቂ Afendi Muteki’s Blog]</ref>

Afendi has published two books: the first one titled “ሀረር ጌይ፡ የአስገራሚዋ ከተማ የኢትኖግራፊ ወጎች” (“Harar Gey”- Ethnographic Tales of the Mystic City) is a comprehensive analysis of the Harari ethnography, the history of Harar, and some important heritages of the city of Harar (the city wall and the five gates). His recent book titled “ኡመተ ፈናን ኡመተ ቀሽቲ ዲሬ ዳዋ” <ref>[http://www.danielkibret.com/2014/07/blog-post_15.html የዳንኤል ክብረት እይታዎች]</ref> is mainly an anthropo-linguistic and historical survey of the city of Dire Dawa; it also contains 12 other tales of ethnography, history art and culture.
