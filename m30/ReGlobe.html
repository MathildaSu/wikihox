==History==
Manak Waste Management Pvt Ltd, the company behind the ReGlobe portal, was founded in 2009 by Mandeep Manocha and Nakul Kumar. Before launching Reglobe.in in 2012, the company conceptualized and implemented the take back campaign of a mobile phone manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web|last=YS|first=Team|title=ReGlobe (Manak Waste Management Pvt Ltd)|url=http://yourstory.com/2010/02/nakul-kumar-and-mandeep-manocha-directors-founders-reglobe-manak-waste-management-pvt-ltd/|accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref> In October 2013, Indian e-commerce giant, [http://www.snapdeal.com/ Snapdeal] partnered with ReGlobe<ref>{{cite web|last=Sareen|first=Pooja|title=Snapdeal goes OLX way introduces Reglobe|url=http://www.iamwire.com/2013/10/snapdeal-olx-introduces-reglobe-amazon-launches-android-app-india/|accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref> to take their service to a larger Indian audience, so that their customers could easily sell their old laptops and mobiles phones online.<ref>{{cite web|last=YS|first=Team|title=Snapdeal ties up with ReGlobe |url=http://www.medianama.com/2013/10/223-snapdeal-reglobe/|accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref>

ReGlobe has been recently funded by Blume ventures and Bessemer venture partners.<ref>http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-29/news/61652655_1_blume-ventures-bessemer-venture-partners-start-up-ecosystem</ref>

==How it Works==
Reglobe.in allows users to sell their old used laptops and mobile phones on their Sell Platform. Users can buy refurbished laptops and mobile phones on their buy platform. On the Sell Platform, Reglobe helps users calculate the current worth of their old laptop, mobile or tablet by making them answer a few objective questions like model number, defects in the device and physical condition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Behl|first=Ashish|title=Recyclers|url=http://www.fridaygurgaon.com/news/3078-recyclers.html|accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref> Once the customer agrees to the quoted price, Reglobe arranges for the pick-up of the device and pays the money via cash or bank transfer. Reglobe makes sure that all the data is wiped off from the device as soon as it reaches their refurbishing facility. All laptops go through a sixteen step check and overhaul of the hardware, so while the OS will remain the same, you’ll may be able to get a second-hand one with a new battery, updated keyboard and so on.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reglobe: Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot
