'''Paternoster Press''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Christian]] publishing house which was founded by [[Howard Mudditt]] in 1936. Mudditt was a [[Bank of England]] clerk who decided to move into publishing after seeing the many publishers based on London's [[Paternoster Row]] during his lunch hours; the firm was named after the street, rather than being due to any [[Roman Catholic]] connections.

Paternoster's early lists were theological, and the firm eventually relocated to [[Exeter]]. In 1992 it was purchased by the Christian book distributor [[Send the Light]] as part of their ''Authentic Media'' division based in [[Milton Keynes]]. Paternosterâ€™s imprints include Regnum (an academic list) and Rutherford House (a popular historical list); it also publishes books with specific imprints for organisations such as WEF ([[World Evangelisation Fellowship]]), YWAM ([[Youth with a Mission]]) and [[Spring Harvest]].

In December 2009, as part of the failure of STL ([[Send the Light]]), Paternoster was sold to Australian-based company [[Koorong]], which, prior to this, was primarily a retailer of Christian books, music and gifts.
