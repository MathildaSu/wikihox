'''Rionne McAvoy''' (born 2 July 1986) pronounced rye-own, is an [[Australian]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] of [[English people|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, currently signed to [[Wrestling New Classic]] (WNC), where he works under the ring name Fujiwara Rionne.<ref name="WNC">{{cite web|url=http://wnc-pro.com/wrestler/wrestler22.php|title=Rionne McAvoy|accessdate=13 May 2013|work=[[Wrestling New Classic]]|language=Japanese}}</ref> He is also an independent [[film director]], [[kickboxer]], 3rd degree [[Aikido]] blackbelt, and former [[Australian]] state [[Karate]] champion.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} McAvoy made the transition from martial arts to professional wrestling in April 2012.  In addition to his wrestling Rionne is a respected film maker in Japan.<ref name="GaijinAss">{{cite web|url=http://gaijinass.com/2012/01/17/interview-with-sceptre-films-rionne-mcavoy/|title=Interview with Rionne McAvoy}}</ref>

McAvoy practiced [[Karate]] during his elementary and high school days and won the 2000 [[Queensland]] state championships. He first visited [[Japan]] when he was 19 for [[Karate]] before switching to [[Aikido]] when he was 21. His father, a 4th degree [[Aikido]] teacher, taught him how to roll and fall when he was younger, and the progression to [[Aikido]] was natural for him. McAvoy also joined the world famous Ihara [[Kickboxing]] gym and continues to practice there.

==Professional wrestling career==
[[File:Rionne entrance.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rionne entering the ring]]
At the end of 2011, a chance meeting with then [[Smash (professional wrestling)|Smash]] wrestler [[Akira Nogami]] convinced him that his future lay in pro wrestling. When Smash closed its doors in January 2012, McAvoy joined the [[Wrestling New Classic]] (WNC) dojo in April of that year. Wrestling New Classic is operated by former [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] superstar [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]], one of McAvoy's trainers.<ref name="wrestlingdata.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&wrestler=26714|title=Rionne McAvoy}}</ref>

McAvoy debuted on 28 February 2013 and adopted the [[Professional wrestling holds#Koji Clutch|Koji Clutch]] as his finish, later tweaking it and renaming it the "Rionne Clutch".<ref name="WNC"/>

At the 27 June WNC [[Shinjuku Face]] event, Rionne decided to do away with the normal rookie black pants for something a little more fancy. He adopted the flag of Australia as his main design.<ref name="CageMatch.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=13452|title=Yankee Rionne Bio}}</ref>

At the 29 August [[Shinjuku Face]] event, Rionne defeated Jiro Kuroshio with a Crossface Chickenwing. He announced straight after the match that he wanted to wrestle the legendary [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]] at WNC's 31 October Korakuen Hall event.<ref name="keepingthespiritalive.tumblr.com">{{cite web|url=http://keepingthespiritalive.tumblr.com/post/59682324689/wnc-results-for-august-29-2013|title=WNC Results August 29th}}</ref> After losing to Fujiwara, McAvoy was given the new ring name Rionne Fujiwara as he was accepted as the latest recruit to the Fujiwara Gumi (group).<ref>http://keepingthespiritalive.tumblr.com/post/65611476723/wnc-tajiri-vs-taka-michinoku-results-for-october-31</ref>

After WNC's first show of 2014 where Rionne tapped out his opponent with a Fujiwara Arm bar to pick up the win, Rionne announced that in April he will be making his North American debut for Squared Circle Wrestling. He will face former [[WWE]] superstar [[Matt Hardy]], and local star Jay Freddie.
