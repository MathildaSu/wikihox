'''Doug Ralph''' (b. 1948 Castlemaine, d. 24 February 2015, Castlemaine) was an historian,<ref>Slattery, Bernard J, Ralph, D. (Doug), Slattery, Deirdre and Friends of the Box-Ironbark Forests Vagabond : the story of Charles Sanger. Friends of the Box Ironbark Forests, Castlemaine, Vic, 2008.</ref> environmentalist and activist.

==Early life==
Doug Ralph was the fifth generation descendant of ancestors who came to [[Mount Alexander]] in the [[Victorian Gold Rush|Goldrush]] of the 1850s, and he was born in [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]], living in the area most of this life and working as a self-employed carpenter.

==Activism==
A passionate<ref>See [http://centralvicecology.com Doug Ralph's Blog: Central Victorian Ecology]</ref> protector of the local environment,<ref>Shtargot, Sasha (2014). Voice for the voiceless: Sasha Shtargot interviews Doug Ralph. In EarthSong Journal: Perspectives in Ecology, Spirituality and Education. 2 (8), 24-25.</ref>  in 1997 Ralph became founding president of the [http://www.fobif.org.au Friends of the Box Ironbark Forests], for whom he conducted bush walks for more than fifty years, from the late 1990s, and became known as a mentor of younger artists[http://thecorioliseffect.moonfruit.com/#/castlemaine-gathering-2/4576760558] and environmentalists.[http://www.focusoncommunity.org/OurCarbonHeroes.html] Ralph was influential in the campaign for the registration of a [[Box-Ironbark]] [[National park]].

:: ''"Historically,the early white settlers described the land as “park-like” – the forests had big trees with space in between. That’s what (British explorer) Major Mitchell described when he came through this area. But they cut down the big trees and when you do that you get a denser, coppiced, multi stemmed growth.[...] Once grazing stops, life comes back from nowhere. Where I live there were cattle for over 100 years, but the land is repairing itself. Even where you’ve had the worst impacts of mining, [...] where the land has been sluiced, it’s regenerating. You can strip the land bare but a seed will still germinate, a blade of grass will still come up."''  <ref>Shtargot, Sasha (2014). Voice for the voiceless: Sasha Shtargot interviews Doug Ralph. In EarthSong Journal: Perspectives in Ecology, Spirituality and Education. 2 (8), 24-25.</ref>
