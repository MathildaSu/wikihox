'''Fusion Jonda''' is a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] band that blends the [[Caribbean music]] with gypsy-flamenco sounds, melodies and rhythms. The band also centers its music in a combination of [[Afrobeat]], [[Jazz]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Indian music]] elements achieving a contemporary approach.

As for the band’s name, the word ''Jonda'', a Spanish anachronism for “deep”, is related to the [[Cante Jondo]] (in English, Deep Singing), the very origin of Flamenco. The band sets ground on those flamenco roots and the “Fusion” begins as they implement the Hispanic, Indian and African harmonies that have been inherited in the Caribbean.

== History ==
Fusion Jonda began in 2010 as a trio around its creator, musician-singer-songwriter Juan Luis Romero, percussionist Wilfredo “El Canela” Dávila and [[flamenco]] dancer Patricia Muñiz. From [[Salsa music]], [[rock music]] to jazz sceneries, the music blends had not been unfamiliar to bandleader Romero who is from Puerto Rican and [[Dominican]] descent and belongs to a family dedicated to music, poetry, journalism, law and education. He studied piano and music composition at a very young age when he dreamed to produce musical interchanges between rhythms from the [[Antilles]] and [[Latin America]]. At age 13, he led his first orchestra and afterwards, he had a jazz band not without first being singer for a [[heavy metal music]] band, [[tenor]] of a [[Gospel music]] choir, chorister for the salsa legends [[Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz]] and pianist for several [[Tropical music]] bands. He is also a lawyer since 1990.

Fusion Jonda has evolved from being a flamenco trio to a one-of-a-kind musical ensemble; an array of talented musicians from different genres like [[reggae]], rock, jazz, salsa and world music bringing together the seductive sounds of the violin, the crispness of the trumpet and trombone, the modern vibes of the bass and the exotic ethnic percussion. They all share the common goal of blending their collected inspirations creating a new, sophisticated sound. Special appearances by urban poet and rapper Javier “Insurgente” Velázquez and a tribal fusion dancer also take place during their live performances.

The band got its first major break in 2012 when it was invited to perform at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum]] alongside [[Spain|Spanish]] singer [[Rosario Flores]] in front of a crowd of 15,000 during the 50th anniversary of the salsa orchestra [[El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico]].<ref>http://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/musica/nota/rosariofloresamadrinaalgrupofusionjonda-2160734  El Nuevo Dia.
