===The Intangible Investor Profiting from Intellectual Property: Companies’ Most Elusive Assets===
''The Intangible Investor'' provides a revealing look at the ways businesses generate returns on inventions and new ideas, and how investors can profit. It explores the controversies surrounding patents and other IP rights, including “trolls,” and the companies, large and small, that rely on inventions and improvements to succeed.

The Intangible Investor goes to the heart of what constitutes the innovation economy: ideas, performance and utilizing [[intellectual property]] rights to generate value.

===From Assets to Profits Competing for IP Value and Return<ref>{{cite news | url=http://ipfrontline.com/2008/10/new-ip-book-businesses-must-challenge-performance-measures/ | title=New IP Book: Businesses Must Challenge Performance Measures | date=October 24, 2008}}</ref>===
Edited by Bruce Berman, and with contributions from the top names in IP management, investment, and consulting, ''From Assets to Profits: Competing for IP Value & Return'' provides a real-world look at how intellectual property assets work and the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which they are used for competitive advantage.

Berman's ''From Ideas to Assets: Investing Wisely in Intellectual Property'' introduced IP as a business asset; his follow-up book, ''Making Innovation Pay: People Who Turn IP into Shareholder Value'', looked at patent licensing as a strategy for business owners large and small. Now, ''From Assets to Profits: Competing for IP Value & Return'' reveals how a deeper awareness of intellectual assets is forcing many businesses to rethink their approach to capturing innovation and generating profit. Visionary and focused, this important book demonstrates how you can identify valuable intellectual assets and discover the most effective business models for them—especially those that are appropriate for particular IP holders.

Not all IP rights are assets, but identifying which ones are—and then appropriately monetizing them—is a challenge, whether you are an IP manager, senior executive, investor, [[entrepreneur]] or a so-called patent "troll." From Assets to Profits reveals the most relevant ways to generate return on innovation, with advice and essential guidance from battle-tested IP pros.

===Making Innovation Pay People Who Turn IP Into Shareholder Value ===

''Making Innovation Pay'' not only examines best practices, it explores the diverse personalities of those who have pioneered them. Most are mavericks, perhaps not admired by their adversaries or recognized on [[Wall Street]], but quintessentially American in their desire to succeed where others fear to tread. ''Making Innovation Pay'' illuminates the combination of resources, timing, teamwork, and vision necessary to turn business rights into financial assets. Finally, it challenges senior managements to better deploy their patent portfolios in support of shareholder value. Within these chapters, you will learn why [[shareholders]], CEOs, and others need to be much smarter about IP—or become a victim of it.
