The '''Punti''', a rough transliteration of a [[Cantonese]] term for "original locality", refers to the [[Yue Chinese|Yue]]-speaking populations of [[Guangdong]] in southern China.<ref>{{Google books|wkh1opdA_BcC|Guest People: Hakka Identity in China and Abroad|page=10}}</ref> A group of people who speak Punti language can be regarded as '''Punti people'''. They are contrasted with another [[Han Chinese]] linguistic group, the [[Hakka people|Hakka]], which settled in the area after the '''Punti peoples'''.

==History==
{{Main|Hong Kong during Imperial China}}

It is both documented and generally viewed to various extent that mass exodus of largely the people of [[Han Chinese]] ethnicity migrated from north to south of the [[Yangtze River]] during the war and upheavals of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], the [[Jurchen-Khitan Wars]], the fall of the Northern [[Song dynasty]], the [[Mongol]] conquest of the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jurchen Jin Dynasty]] and finally the Southern Song Dynasty pushed generations of refugees into the area including the descendants of the Chinese patriotic leader [[Wen Tianxiang]]. The "[[Great Five Clans]]" – the [[Hou (surname)|Hau]] (侯), [[Tang Clan|Tang]] (鄧), [[Peng (surname)|Pang]] (彭), [[Liao (surname)|Liu]] (廖), and Man (文) – were among the earliest recorded familial settlers of Hong Kong. Despite the immigration and light development of agriculture, the area was still relatively barren and had to rely on salt, [[pearl]] and [[fisheries in Hong Kong|fishery trade]]s.

===Punti-Hakka Clan Wars===
{{Main|Punti-Hakka Clan Wars}}

From 1854 to 1867 there were a series of battles between the Punti and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] peoples, concentrated mainly in the County of Xinning (present day the City of [[Taishan]]).

==Usage in Hong Kong==
Punti has become a commonly used word in [[Judiciary of Hong Kong|Hong Kong law courts]] and other authorities such as the police; it is a transliteration of Cantonese 'Boon Dei' meaning 'local'. When a defendant chooses to use Punti in court, he elects to use Cantonese Chinese as the language of [[trial (law)|trial]] instead of English. Despite the reference of "Punti" in this context means nothing more than "Cantonese Chinese" as a spoken language and the [[Hong Kong Cantonese Chinese|Hong Kong variation of the language]], there are political and practical reasons of not using direct reference to the word "Cantonese Chinese".

Practically, "Cantonese Chinese" can be used to mean all the Chinese dialects of the [[Guangdong]], and the Cantonese Chinese spoken in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), is different in both accent and vocabulary than that in Hong Kong.

Nonetheless, the difference is becoming less significant as the Guangdong province is becoming more and more influenced by Hong Kong culture and vocabulary, thanks to the wide Hong Kong television coverage in [[Northern and southern China|Southern China]]. Further, the influx of immigrants and visitors from Guangdong also means their use of vocabulary finds its way to daily Hong Kong usage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The place of origin of the Punti is [[Bao'an County|Bao'an]], Guangdong, a former county that encompassed what is now Hong Kong and [[Shenzhen]], China.
