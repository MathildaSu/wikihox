| quote = "I think that we had a lot of fun on [it]..... I feel like I was able to pull a lot of imagery from really early [Eastern-influenced] stuff that I did [when I was a kid and young songwriter], and it was a lot of fun to get into the Bollywood sort of theme 'cause I know she's always had an obsession with that too. I think they're pretty classic themes that she goes over. When you're writing love songs, it's always forever; they seem to always last throughout time."

==Critical reception==
[[File:BonnieMcKeePerforming.png|thumb|220px|left|[[Bonnie McKee]] (''pictured'') co-wrote "Legendary Lovers" with Luke, Martin, Cirkut, and Perry.]]
"Legendary Lovers" received mostly mixed reviews from music critics, who despite praising the instrumentation and overall production, criticized its lyrical content. Helen Brown from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' found the lyrics to be subpar to the "great, playfully exotic tune", describing them as being "of the level you might find in a day spa".<ref name="brown"/> Jon Dolan from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' compared the song to works by [[Robyn]] and [[Lykke Li]], stating that they "go for a darker, moodier intimacy", and that they "set stark revelations to torrential Euro splendor".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dolan, Jon|title=Katy Perry 'Prism' Review|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/prism-20131016|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Wenner Media LLC]]|accessdate=January 1, 2014|date=October 16, 2013}}</ref> Allison Stewart from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the lyrics as "one-size-fits-all spiritual catchphrases of someone who once read a self-help book in an airport".<ref>{{cite web|author=Stewart, Allison|title=Album review: Katy Perry grows up, gets spiritual on 'Prism'|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/album-review-katy-perry-grows-up-gets-spiritual-on-prism/2013/10/21/f7d26706-39ef-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth]]|accessdate=January 1, 2014|date=October 22, 2013}}</ref>

Natalie Palmer from [[Gigwise|Entertainmentwise]] wrote that the song's instrumentation, particularly the bhangra beat, contributed to make it "the most spiritual track on the album".<ref name="wise">{{cite web|author=Palmer, Natalie|title=REVIEW: Katy Perry – 'Prism'|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/reviews/129967/REVIEW-Katy-Perry-Prism|publisher=Entertainmentwise.

Glenn Gamboa from ''[[Newsday]]'' was not impressed with the lyrical content, describing the song as "such a bad 'tribute' to [[Buddhism]] and [[Indian music]] that it's practically a joke, with lyrics like 'I feel my lotus bloom' and 'You are my destiny, my mantra'".<ref>{{cite web|author=Gamboa, Glenn|title='Prism' review: Katy Perry is all over the place|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/prism-review-katy-perry-is-all-over-the-place-1.6280564|work=[[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]], Fred Groser|accessdate=January 1, 2014|date=October 18, 2013}}</ref> Jason Lipshutz from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' did not criticize the lyrics, but instead focused on the "unforgivingly clobbered" drums heard during the chorus.<ref name="track"/> During his review of ''Prism'', Adam R.
