==Quotes==
In a 2013 interview for [[Transpersonal Spirt]]
Hoffmann:
“My work is an attempt to show spirit as the universal force which unifies us beyond the confines of cultural and religious differences. By accepting the interdependency of all life and our universal interconnectedness we have a chance to heal and transform the planet’s general state of woundedness. In using art as a tool for transformation, we have the opportunity to create a reality as beautiful, healthy and strong as our imagination permits.”<ref name="Martina Hoffmann Website, www.MartinaHoffmann.com/about, 2017">{{cite web|last=Hoffmann|first=Martina|title=Visionary Artist About: Martina Hoffmann (biography)|url=http://www.martinahoffmann.com/about|publisher=2 February 13th, 2013}}</ref>
