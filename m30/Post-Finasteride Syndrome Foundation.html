The '''Post-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization based in the [[United States]] focused on what it calls "post-finasteride syndrome." The foundation says this syndrome consists of sexual, neurological, hormonal and psychological side effects which can persist in men who have taken [[finasteride]] for hair loss or an enlarged prostate, and has funded research into the effects of using finasteride.<ref name=Margo>{{cite journal|last1=Margo|first1=Jill|title=Looking at care with a critical eye|journal=[[Australian Financial Review]]|date=September 26, 2012|url=http://www.afr.com/p/lifestyle/mens_health/looking_at_care_with_critical_eye_ZRbAzUV4cRxZhspW7YRwBJ}}{{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Vittorio|title=Post-Finaseride Syndrome Foundation funds 3 clinical studies on permanent side effects of prostate cancer, alopecia drug|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/post-finaseride-syndrome-foundation-funds-3-clinical-studies-permanent-side-effects-prostate-cancer|accessdate=11 November 2015|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> The term "post-finasteride syndrome" has gained attention in the media.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hipolit|first1=Melissa|title=How one man said hair loss drug ruined his life|url=http://wtvr.com/2015/04/30/hair-loss-drug/|agency=WTVR|date=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

==Public response==
A [[HealthNewsReview.org]] article written by a site investigator for the original trials for finasteride said the suggestions offered by the foundation seemed hyperbolic, stating that promotion by the group has led to news reports  that "skewed toward worst-case scenarios and personal stories highlighting speculative harms of the drug" and the foundation has misrepresented the views of the [[National Institute of Health]] with regard to the existence of such a syndrome.<ref name=Hoffman>{{cite web|last1=Hoffman|first1=Richard|title=Advocacy group spin may skew discussion on finasteride side effects|url=http://www.healthnewsreview.org/2015/08/advocacy-group-spins-harms-from-post-finasteride-syndrome/|publisher=HealthNewsReview.org|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>
