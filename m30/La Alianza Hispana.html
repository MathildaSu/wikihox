'''La Alianza Hispana''' is a community-based multi-service agency created to address the needs and desires of the Hispanic residents in Boston. It was created in 1968 by Ana Maria Rodriguez, professor of English as a second language at an elementary school, after experiencing the poor conditions of her Latino students. Since its foundation, its primary goals have been to support the needs of Spanish speaking immigrants with a low income—mainly those that live in [[Dorchester, Boston|North Dorchester]] and [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]]—and to pursue solutions to their problems. It also addresses the quality of human services to help and promote the improvement of the community. La Alianza Hispania became the first Latino organization that had an active start up and still continues to spread across Boston.

==  Programs ==

	'''La Alianza Hispana''' is a complex service agency. It functions in a decentralized manner: it is organized into different units that, by focusing on a particular topic, work to achieve the organization’s overall goals.  The programs are administered under four units:  The Youth Center, Counseling and Advocacy, Adult Education, and Mental Health. 
	
	Youth are an important resource for the community’s present and future, but there had been a lack of development in this important sector. The Youth Development unit was established in 1978 to expand and integrate the youth program. It focuses on children’s services, education and counseling and advocacy. This unit helped La Alizana Hispana to reorient its youth service towards inspiring youth leadership development.  Examples of activities include childcare, tutoring and after school programs for middle school children and those living near Roxbury.  The use of recreational activities such as karate classes and sports leagues allowed children to develop better relationships with one another, and be pro-active. Counseling services for teens increased teens' awareness about health issues such as teen pregnancy and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDs.]]
	
The Latino Family Counseling Center is another program that focuses on providing counseling services for children, adolescents and adults. It aids its clients by finding available resources such as  welfare, housing, food and social security. The Counseling Center's intention is to provide services which increase a client family's capacity of developing long term behaviors that prevent and reduce the consequences and causes of their problems. These services include mental health, sexual abuse, and substance abuse counseling, and a support group for LGBTQ youth and their families. By increasing its clients' access to community resources, the Center seeks to empower individuals to cope with behavioral and mental health issues, as well as tackle universal challenges by providing appropriate guidelines as a model to follow.  Currently, the agency wants to partner with a parent clinic with the purpose of obtaining the necessary license for third party payments.

== Funding Resources ==
	La Alianza has expanded tremendously since it was founded tripling its operational budget. Currently there are about 5,000 clients seen per year. The majority of the programs don’t charge any fee for the services provided due to the extreme poverty of the clients that are being served. Therefore a combination of sources fund La Alianza Hispana’s programs. For example in the Youth Center Unit there are different providers such as department for social services and the department of public health.  Besides public sources, the Alianza is also funded by private sources. [[United Way of America]], a non-profit organization that works throughout the country in a partnership of charitable organization to increase efforts in fundraising and support, provides 18% of their current funding while others provide 6-7% of the current operating costs.

== Facing Problems ==
Sustainability and the flow of information are major issues at La Alianza. There is no internal reporting in the programs, which can lead to duplication since clients served are not tracked from one program to the next. As a result of the expansion of the agency, the size and capacity have grown to the point where an in depth inspection of the flow of information within the organization needed to take place. The implementation of a management information system would allow the agency to gather discrete client information from each unit. It will also improve efficiency of staff and evaluate the programs for long term planning. This will also permit the administration to have a clear understanding of the actual population that belongs to the agency and have more control of basic client demographic information once individuals become part  of the agency.<ref>Francisco, R.
