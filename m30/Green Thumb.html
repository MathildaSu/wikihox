==Plot summary==

Pudgy misanthropic boy genius Grady Jacobs wins a scholarship to participate in rainforest research and conservation. Upon discovering that our Grady is only thirteen, Dr. Carter, the scientist in charge, relegates him to the position of camp drudge. A healthier diet and menial labor transforms Grady both physically and emotionally, making him a better and more balanced boy.

During the course of his duties, Grady somehow discovers a way to communicate with trees. This fantastic power eventually comes in useful when it is discovered that Dr. Carter's project would in fact lead to the destruction of the rainforest. [[Category:1999 novels]]
