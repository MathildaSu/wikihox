<big>'''Arthur Brett and Sons'''</big>

Arthur Brett is a well known maker of fine English furniture and is thought to be the oldest extant cabinet making company in England. The business is located in [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk]] from where it traces its origins to the early 19th century. Specializing in authentic English historical design Arthur Brett works with both private individuals and interior design and architect practices around the world. The company creates bespoke furniture and architectural interiors such as paneled rooms and libraries. With international distributors in key markets it has its main showroom at 103 [[Pimlico Road]], London SW1.

'''Furniture Design'''<br /></big>

Arthur Brett is renowned for the authenticity of its historical designs both in terms of appearance and construction detail. Period designs are made entirely by hand in the same way as the originals and largely indistinguishable. The company specializes in Georgian furniture and replicates designs attributed to famous makers such as [[Thomas Chippendale]], [[William Vile]] and [[Thomas Hope]], or inspired by others such as [[Thomas Sheraton]] and [[George Hepplewhite]].<br />
Exact historical replicas include the [[Nostell Priory]] Desk, made by [[Thomas Chippendale]] for Sir Roland Winn and reproduced in conjunction with the [[National Trust]], and [[Napoleon]]'s Campaign Chair, recreated in a limited edition from the original at [[Goodwood House]].<br />
Although firmly grounded in English historical furniture design, increasingly Arthur Brett produces custom furniture designs for interiors projects. Some may be loosely based on period designs from within the collection and others entirely new designs. The company also works with contemporary finishes including man-made veneers, metals, glass and marble.

<big>'''History'''<br /></big>

The Arthur Brett business traces its origins to John Brett, a chair maker who was born in Norfolk in 1815. His son Jonathan T Brett joined his father in business sometime around or before 1860, going on to establish the firm of Jonathan T Brett and Sons in 1870. Jonathan had six sons and the third of these, Arthur, went on to grow his part of the family business substantially. Renamed Arthur Brett and Sons, the company had an antiques department and a furniture making business with showrooms in Norwich and across Norfolk, culminating in the opening of a showroom in London's [[Fitzroy Square]] between the wars. Upon Arthur's death in 1952 the business was advanced by his sons, ably lead by Frank Brett, and then again by the next generation of brothers Edward and James. By the early twenty first century, however, the UK was beginning to suffer from the effects of cheap furniture imports from the Far East and Arthur Brett & Sons could no longer sustain the substantial workforce of craftsmen employed across all disciplines from cabinet making and polishing to brass casting. The company's operations were slimmed down substantially with a move away from working with retailers and greater focus being placed on the manufacture of high quality bespoke furniture for project work. In 2006 Arthur Brett was bought by the McLaren Group; it continues to operate independently from premises in Norwich and London.

Athur Brett & Sons is a member of the Association for British Furniture Manufacturers (BFM) a corporate member of the [[Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers]] from whom it holds four Guild marks, and a member of the [[Furniture Ombudsman]].

<big>'''Projects'''</big>

From mainly working with the public in the 19th and greater part of the 20th century, the majority of Arthur Brett's business today is with interior design companies and architectural practices. The company's furniture can be found in many prestigious buildings around the world including private homes and palaces, luxury hotels and government institutions including the [[Bank of England]]. Arthur Brett works around the world with a significant proportion of its business emanating from Russia, the Middle East and the USA.

In 1994 Arthur Brett was commissioned to build the summit conference table for the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] in [[Bahrain]]. The table was designed by [[Paris]] company Pierre Yves Rochon, measured over 6 metres in diameter and featured seven seating areas with a specially cast hemisphere of the earth in its centre. The whole project was completed in three months. <br />[[File:1994_GCC_conference_table.jpg|thumb|right|Gulf Co-operation Council - Bahrain conference table]]

Other prestigious projects include the Arcadian Library in London and [[the Lanesborough]] hotel. Arthur Brett supplied furniture for the original hotel launch in 1990 and again for the 2015 refurbishment.<br />
 
The project to convert [[Admiralty Arch]] into the Admiralty Arch Hotel, launched in 2016, is supported by Arthur Brett who supplied various items of furniture for the model suite.

The company was asked to supply furniture for the British House in [[Rio de Janeiro]] during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], an exhibition designed to showcase the best of British goods and services.<ref>Eastern Daily Press, 09-08-2016, p.39</ref>
