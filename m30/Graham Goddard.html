The exhibition received over 100,000 visitors while it was open. Inspired by [[land art]]ists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]] and [[Christo and Jeanne Claude]], Graham Goddard displayed blueprints designed to instruct the viewer how to build "Paradigm" for themselves, suggesting that anyone could create what Goddard created and contribute to constructive ecological action to renew the environment.

==="Paradigm"- Site-specific installation===
"Paradigm" is part of a series of [[land art]]works by Graham Goddard designed to investigate their surrounding environments as objects consisting of a process of ongoing relationships between man and nature while addressing our ecological responsibility towards a healthy environment tomorrow.

Graham Goddard places “Paradigm” in multiple locations that are at risk and affected by pollution, such as mountains, deserts and watersheds. For an "Idea Called Tomorrow" at the Skirball Museum and the California African American Museum, Goddard proposed the installation of “Paradigm” in the [[Ballona Creek]], a toxic watershed in [[Culver City, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailyserving.com/tag/california/|title=An Idea Called Tomorrow|publisher=Daily Serving}}</ref>

Graham Goddard is scheduled to have a solo exhibition at LA Artcore on March 2, 2011 - March 27, 2011. The exhibition, titled "Graham Goddard's American Playground," will feature a new body of work by the artist, including his controversial painting "America at Play," which explores the major issues that the United States has faced for the last 10 years. Highlighting the [[discrimination]], [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and [[controversial]] topics that affect Americans, the painting uses a playground of children as a metaphor for the United States’ tumultuous political climate.  “America at Play” addresses the issues of [[Same Sex Marriage]], [[immigration]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] exploitation, [[Polygamy]], the [[World Trade Center bombing]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]].

===Music & Expressionism===
On October 12, 2015 Graham Goddard launched a new body of work that merges music and Neo-expressionist painting. The new work consists of large-scale (6&nbsp;ft) rotating paintings that were simultaneously created with the poetry and songs. During the creative process, Graham Goddard partnered with musician and music producer, Patrick Graves, to create the songs in the series. "Run to the Light," the first song and painting introduced, addressed Goddard's struggle with aspiring for more while being stagnant in life. Each song and painting in the new series is scheduled to be released in increments by Goddard throughout 2016 and 2017.

==Philanthropy and Community Involvement==
Graham Goddard has been a [[guest speaker]] at colleges and high schools including [[Loyola Marymount University]], the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Fox Lane High School]] in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]].

In 2008 Graham Goddard launched the [[Surrender (spirituality and psychology)#In Christianity|"Surrender a Moment to God"]] project which encourages at-risk [[inner city]] youth to contribute to a large painting by drawing, painting, or writing statements explaining what [[Surrender (spirituality and psychology)#In Christianity|surrendering to God]] means to them.  Over 200 at-risk youth in [[Southern California]] have contributed to the project. Goddard believes that when young people are faced with tough circumstances, the simplest and most powerful thing they can do is get closer to God.
