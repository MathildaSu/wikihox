The '''Illinois Fair Tax''' is a proposed amendment to the [[Illinois]] [[Constitution of Illinois|state constitution]] that would change the [[state income tax]] system from a [[flat tax]] to a [[graduated income tax]]. Proponents argue that the proposal would make the Illinois tax code fairer, provide tax relief to the most Illinoisans, boost small businesses, and accelerate job creation <ref name="capitolfax">{{cite web|url=http://capitolfax.com/2014/03/06/fun-with-numbers-28/|title=Capitol Fax.com - Your Illinois News Radar &raquo; Fun with numbers|publisher=capitolfax.com|accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref><ref name="dailyherald">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140311/discuss/140319867|title=Businesses need a fairer Illinois income tax - DailyHerald.com|publisher=dailyherald.com|accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref> Opponents argue it would open the door to tax hikes that hurt small businesses and drive more job creation to neighboring states.<ref>{{cite web

==Legislative history==
Under current law, Illinois's state income tax rate in 2015 will be a flat rate of 3.75 percent, a scheduled phase-out of a 2011 temporary tax increase. Illinois lawmakers are wary of extending the increase, as they fear the impact of an extension on Illinois's business climate.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/30/us-usa-illinois-tax-idUSBREA0T20I20140130  |title= Powerful Illinois House Speaker pushes corporate tax cut

State Rep. [[Naomi Jakobsson]], an [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] proposed and advanced HJRCA 33, the initial [[Illinois House of Representatives|House]] legislative vehicle for the proposal. The bill contains no tax rate schedule, which led the Urbana-Champaign [[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|News-Gazette]] editorial board to criticize statements by the proposal's advocates.<ref name="Legislator at war with tax facts">{{cite web

The [[Illinois Senate|Senate]] companion bill, SJRCA 40, passed the Senate Executive Subcommittee on constitutional amendments. It has advanced to the Senate Executive Committee.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://altondailynews.com/news/details.cfm?clientid=17&id=120898#.U02CxvldX78 | title =Income Tax Amendments}}</ref> 

The proposal failed to make the deadline to clear the Senate, and was withdrawn for 2014.<ref>{{cite web

==Rates==
Three-year budget projections based on current law show a state budget deficit of $2.4 billion in FY2015 and a $4.4 billion deficit in FY2016.  The non-partisan business group Civic Federation of Chicago assessment of the Governor's budget projections estimates that the prescribed cut in income tax will yield decreased revenues of $1.4 billion in FY15 growing to $2.7 billion in FY16.<ref>{{cite web | title= Governor's Budget Projection Shows Illinois' Continuing Financial Woes | publisher=Civic Federation of Chicago | url= http://www.civicfed.org/iifs/blog/governors-budget-projection-shows-states-continuing-financial-woes}}</ref> In its own analysis, the federation projected that the loss of revenue "would dramatically destabilize Illinois' already weak financial condition." They argue that the loss of revenue is bad for Illinois' businesses, due in part to the fact that the state still owes many private businesses money.<ref>{{cite web|title=STATE OF ILLINOIS FY2015 BUDGET ROADMAP|url=http://www.civicfed.org/sites/default/files/FY2015%20State%20of%20Illinois%20Budget%20Roadmap.pdf|publisher=Civic Federation of Chicago|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref>

While Gov. Quinn has proposed extending the 5 percent flat tax indefinitely, other groups have sought to use the graduated tax to raise revenues.<ref>{{cite web | title=State income tax a study in expediency | last1=Secter | first1=Bob | publisher=Chicago Tribune | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-30/news/ct-income-tax-increase-debate-met-20140330_1_income-tax-property-tax-rebate-bruce-rauner}}</ref> The graduated tax proposals would yield an increase in taxes for most taxpayers above current law, although not necessarily the 5 percent rate.

While initial proposals lacked statutory tax rate language leading to criticism from one editorial board,<ref name="Legislator at war with tax facts"/> Sen. [[Don Harmon]] (D-Oak Park) proposed a marginal rate schedule that taxed the first $12,500 of income at 2.9 percent, the range from $12,500 to $180,000 at 4.9 percent, and taxed all income over $180,000 at 6.9 percent. The rate schedule is not part of the amendment, but instead separate legislation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Finke|first=Doug|title=State lawmaker unveils progressive income tax plan|newspaper=State Journal-Register|date=March 25, 2014 | url=http://www.sj-r.com/article/20140325/NEWS/140329582/10511/NEWS?tag=1}}</ref>

Senator Harmon's proposal is estimated to reduce the tax bill of the Illinois median taxpayer (making $55,317 per year) by $303 per year versus the 5 percent rate. Allowing current law to continue would reduce the median taxpayer's bill by $689 per year, an additional savings of $386 versus the Harmon rates.<ref>{{cite news|last=T.J.|first=Fowler|title=Rate structure proposed for progressive income tax|url=http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/rate-structure-proposed-for-progressive-income-tax/article_996ff780-bb88-54a1-9a56-d8f660714ce0.html|newspaper=Quad Cities Times|date=March 25, 2014}}</ref> Other speculative proposals have called for top marginal rates as high as 11 percent, but they were not introduced in the state legislature.<ref name="Legislator at war with tax facts"/>

Proponents argue that Harmon;s rate schedule would provide tax relief to 94% of Illinoisans. Opponents and skeptics contend that is misleading since current law prescribes a decline in the personal income tax rate to 3.75 percent in 2015, after the expiration of a 2011 temporary surtax. They contend Harmon calculates his claimed tax relief from current rates rather than current law.<ref>{{cite web |title = Rate structure proposed for progressive income tax |url= http://herald-review.com/business/local/rate-structure-proposed-for-progressive-income-tax/article_40fdcb3f-5a4b-58a7-8cf6-2b09c7bac5b9.html}}</ref>

Proponents argue that it is misleading to suggest Harmon's rates are anything but a tax cut because many Illinois residents would pay less in 2015 than they pay now.<ref>{{cite web|title=500 Religious Leaders March in Support of Fair Tax, Tell Illinois Policy Institute to Stop Misinformation Campaign|url=http://www.communityrenewalsociety.org/newsroom|publisher=Community Renewal Society|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>{{dead link|date=February 2015}}

==Arguments==
Proponents argue for a tax system that includes lower rates for those with lower incomes and higher rates for those with higher incomes, claiming such a system is fairer.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dey|first=Jim|title=Taxation is first order of business for state legislators|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=The News-Gazette | url=http://www.news-gazette.com/opinion/columns/2014-02-23/taxation-first-order-business-state-legislators.html|date=February 23, 2014}}</ref> They point out that low and middle income families pay a percentage in taxes that is two to three twice that of the very rich, when factoring in all state and local taxes paid. They say this is deeply unfair and is due to a lack of investment by the state, which falls on local taxpayers, who are least able to afford it.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rezin|first=Ashlee|title=Illinois Faith Leaders Host Prayer Vigil, Pledge Support For A 'Fair' Income Tax|url=http://www.progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2014/02/25/faith-leaders-host-prayer-vigil-pledge-support-fair-tax-video|newspaper=Progress Illinois|date=2014-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title="Who Pays?

Opponents argue that the change is cover for a state government cash grab.<ref>{{cite news | title=Editorial: The move toward a graduated income tax in Illinois|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=Daily Herald | url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140105/discuss/701059939/|date=January 5, 2014}}</ref> The Harmon rates would generate $23 million less than the 5% flat rate, but increase tax collections over current law.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=T.J.|title=Rate structure proposed for progressive income tax|url=http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/rate-structure-proposed-for-progressive-income-tax/article_996ff780-bb88-54a1-9a56-d8f660714ce0.html|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=Quad Cities Times|date=March 25, 2014}}</ref>  Some members of the public expressed skepticism to a [[SouthtownStar]] writer that the unpopular state government can be trusted to use a graduated system properly.<ref>{{cite news | title= Is 'graduated income tax' too complicated?|last=Kadner | first = Phil |accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=SouthtownStar | url= http://www.suntimes.com/news/26620929-418/is-graduated-income-tax-too-complicated.html#.U02OAvldX78 | date=April 4, 2014}}</ref>
