== History ==

After returning from active duty in the [[First Gulf War]], [[Glen Meakem]] conducted video interviews with his grandparents and collected many of their old photographs. He quickly realized his need for a secure way to store his family’s memorabilia in perpetuity. The rise of digital technology, coupled with Meakem’s vision, led to the formation of FOREVER.<ref>Smit, Deb.[http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/glenmeakham120413.aspx “Glen Meakem believes in the promise of Forever, his followup to FreeMarkets”], “[[Pop City Media]]”, Pittsburgh, 4 December 2013.

== Business Model ==

FOREVER attempts to resolve two issues which have traditionally confronted [[digital storage]] and sharing—ownership and long-term preservation. According to the company’s Terms of Service, users retain ownership of all files they upload even after their passing. In addition, FOREVER guarantees the preservation of those files for the user’s lifetime plus one hundred years, with a goal of thousands of years. In order to achieve this commitment, users pay for "Permanent Gigabytes." These funds are placed in the “FOREVER Guarantee Fund,” a globally diversified investment fund which is restricted and provides income over time like an endowment. 
The fund finances the long-term storage, [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and [[data migration]] of files to ensure they are readable and accessible by devices in the future. FOREVER does not mine user data or sell it to third party advertisers.<ref>[https://www.forever.com/tos “Terms of Service”], Pittsburgh, 14 November 2013. Retrieved on 17 December 2013.</ref> The transmission and storage of all data is [[encrypted]].  Member content on FOREVER is tripled backed up in geographically diverse locations.<ref name="forever">[https://www.forever.com/features “Features”], Pittsburgh, 2013. Retrieved on 17 December 2013.</ref>

However, there are concerns that even with such a fund, should the company winds up, or becomes insolvent, all the files will be lost. <ref>http://www.groovypost.com/reviews/forever-com-permanent-cloud-storage-media-conversion/</ref> The policy for the fund provides that the fund shall belong to the company. <ref>https://www.forever.com/investment_policy </ref> Therefore, one should question whether there is any protection against such probable insolvency or winding up of the company. As stated in the review "Promising to remain a solvent, profitable business for 100 years is a little bold. If you sign up for FOREVER, I suggest asking what would happen if FOREVER doesn’t exist as a company forever." <ref>http://www.groovypost.com/reviews/forever-com-permanent-cloud-storage-media-conversion/</ref>
== Features ==

Currently, FOREVER supports photographs with plans to support documents, video, and audio files.<ref name="bizjournals" /> Members can keep their content private, share with friends and family, or share with the public. Users may also designate account managers who may maintain, edit, or curate based on permissions granted to them by the account holder. In addition to online sharing and permanent storage, FOREVER also offers media conversion services. These include the conversion of physical memorabilia into digital formats as well as [[digital curation]] of accounts.<ref name="forever" />
