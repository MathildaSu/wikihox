==History==
The gallery building is a house, which was used as the administrative center of the village and often used as a meeting place to discuss community affairs. In 2008, conservation work was carried out to the building. The gallery was finally opened in February 2011.

==Architecture==
The gallery is a traditional Malay house. High quality of wood was used to construct the house, namely Merbau, Cengal and teak. Chinese tiles are used for the roof. There are two water tanks to clean feet in front of the stairs with pumpkins and pineapple motifs. The house is rich with various patterns of carving of flora and fauna. The house has six main sections, which are the porch, veranda, main house, living room, bedroom, kitchen and loft.

==Opening time==
The gallery is opened everyday except Monday from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.
