"'''Giant Woman'''" is the twelfth episode of the first season of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The episode follows Steven ([[Zach Callison]]) urging Amethyst and Pearl ([[Michaela Dietz]] and [[Deedee Magno]] respectively) to demonstrate their ability to fuse together into a giant four-armed woman named Opal (guest voiced by [[Aimee Mann]]). Amethyst and Pearl, however, will not stop squabbling.

The episode was written by Joe Johnston and [[Jeff Liu]], with Ki-Yong Bae, Jin-Hee Park and Young-Wha Yoon providing [[animation direction]], Kevin Dart serving as [[art director]] and [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] providing [[supervising direction]]. According to Liu, the episode was worked on nearly a year after premiering. [[Rebecca Sugar]] stated the song "Giant Woman", which she performed at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], was "humbled by the presence" of Mann's guest voice. In the United States, the episode originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on February 24, 2014.

The episode was seen by 1.893 million viewers, becoming the most watched episode aired by the network for the week of April 7 to April 13, 2014. ''Cartoon Brew''{{'s}} Kendra Beltran questioned Steven's desire to see Opal, while highlighting Steven's reaction toward Steven Jr.'s plight as "the moment of the week." ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'s}} Eric Thurm opined that the episode "[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]" contained "no full song from creator and ''[[Adventure Time]]'' musical wizard Rebecca Sugar here along the lines of 'Giant Woman'".
