'''Jubilee USA Network''' is an alliance of churches, diverse faith communities, and labor, environmental, solidarity, and community organizations. The aim of this grassroots movement is to achieve the complete cancellation of debt owed by countries with high levels of human need, the cancellation of [[odious debt]], and an end to the imposition of economic policies as a condition for debt relief. Jubilee USA promotes its mission through public education, [[grassroots organizing]], media outreach, policy analysis and advocacy.In addition, Jubilee USA is also part of a global partnership, with Jubilee organizations in more than 50 countries.  The current Executive Director of the Jubilee USA Network is [http://www.jubileeusa.org/aboutus/jubilee-usa-team/jubilee-staff/ericlecompte.html Eric LeCompte].

==History==
In the late 1990s, a range of religious groups and individuals came together under the banner of [[Jubilee 2000]], engaging with their communities and challenging policy makers to address the crushing debt crisis. This activism may have contributed to subsequent government commitments: During the 1999 [[G8]] meeting in Cologne, Germany, the US promised to cancel 100% of the debt owed to the US by the qualifying countries. Jubilee lobbied Congress to make this pledge a reality. In 2000 and 2001, the US Congress allocated $769 million for bilateral and multilateral debt relief. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

When the Jubilee 2000 Campaign was dissolved, as planned, at the end of 2000, Jubilee USA Network was formed as the US arm of the continued global Jubilee movement.

In 2005, pressure from Jubilee USA Network and global partners in the Global Call to [[Make Poverty History]] helped keep global poverty on the agenda of world leaders. With a US Republican Administration, pressure from the Jubilee movement pushed the issues of debt and global poverty onto the agendas of world leaders. As a result, we can celebrate the more than $100 billion of debt that has been canceled for 29 countries.

In 2007, Jubilee USA generated bi-partisan support for the Jubilee Act {{USBill|110|H.R.|2634}}. The legislation will enable countries to refocus their budgets away from debt service and towards addressing push factors, allowing more people in the developing world to stay in their country of origin. The legislation was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 7 June 2007 as {{USBill|110|H.R.|2634}} and passed the House by a vote of 285-132 with bipartisan support on 16 April 2008. Similar legislation was introduced in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on 16 October 2007 as {{USBill|110|S.|2634}} where it passed the [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] on 24 June 2008. A full vote by the Senate was not held for the legislation and the bill expired on 3 January 2009 with the end of the congressional session. The Jubilee Act was introduced again during the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] in 2010 as {{USBill|111|H.R.|4405}}.

The organization’s successful cultivation of partners allowed it to mobilize a bi-partisan group of forty-eight Members of Congress and 14 high profile religious leaders to send letters to President [[Barack Obama]] showing their support for expanded debt cancellation for impoverished countries without harmful conditions and a fair system of lending and borrowing. 

Through Jubilee USA's  access to the administration and support from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties, it was able to successfully influence President Obama’s September [[United Nations]] speech to include a call to wealthy nations to keep their commitments to poor nations. Jubilee also introduced legislation to stop [[Vulture funds|Vulture Funds]] and the successfully passed the Haiti Debt Relief for Earthquake Recovery Act ({{USBill|111|H.R.|4573}}).  It has received accolades and continued access from key policy makers such as [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] Under Secretary [[Lael Brainard]]. 

Debt campaigners assert that much remains to be done. They state that more countries must be added to the initiative, more creditors included, and economic conditionalities eliminated. [http://www.jubileeusa.org/take_action/unfinished_agenda.pdf The Unfinished Agenda on International Debt]

==Platform==
The following is the platform of the Jubilee USA Network as cited on their website. [http://www.jubileeusa.org/about-us/what-we-believe.html Jubilee Platform]

Recognizing that much of the debt charged to many countries is unjust and unpayable, and profoundly aware of the great social and environmental toll that these debts exact, the Jubilee USA Network calls for a [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee]] cancellation of debt that includes:

# Definitive debt cancellation of the international debt owed by countries burdened with high levels of human need and environmental distress which are unable to meet the basic needs of their people or achieve a level of [[sustainable development]] that ensures a decent quality of life.
# Definitive debt cancellation, in addition, of debts found to be [[odious debt|odious]], wherever they exist, through a just and equitable process not controlled by the creditors;
# Definitive debt cancellation that benefits countries’ impoverished majorities, is accountable to them and advances their authentic participation in determining the direction of their economies and societies;
# Definitive debt cancellation that is not externally conditioned on economic policy prescriptions, such as [[International Monetary Fund]]-designed and imposed [[Structural Adjustment Programs]] (SAPs);
# Acknowledgment of the responsibility of both lenders and borrowers and action to recover resources that were diverted by corrupt and undemocratic regimes, institutions and individuals;
# The emergence of global economic policies and trade rules that eradicate poverty promote sustainable human development and prevent recurring, destructive cycles of indebtedness

This vision of Jubilee calls for the building of right relationships between communities, peoples and nations. In our world today, international cooperation builds true security while the international financial crisis breeds instability, hopelessness and unnecessary suffering. 

In 2011, Jubilee USA is working towards achieving these goals.
# Meet Debt Relief Commitments and Expand Debt Cancellation to More Countries in Need
# Build support for responsible lending and borrowing
# Establish a neutral and fair mechanism to deal with sovereign debt crises (outside Paris Club and HIPC)
# Help low-income countries avoid incurring more unjust debt
# Reform international financial institutions to end harmful conditions attached to debt relief and loans

==Pillars==
The following are the 4 pillars of the Jubilee USA Network as cited on their website. [http://www.jubileeusa.org/whoweare/whatwebelieve.html Jubilee Pillars]
# Implementing responsible borrowing and lending and expanding debt cancellation for indebted poor countries
# Promoting real tax reform by closing tax loopholes and curbing tax havens, which would raise revenue for the   Global South and help to foster a more sustainable future
#Establish an International Bankruptcy Process
#Reform International Financial Institutions to be more accountable and transparent


Jubilee USA will continue to work towards making this vision of restorative justice a reality throughout our world.
