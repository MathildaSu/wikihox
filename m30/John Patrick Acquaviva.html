'''John Patrick Acquaviva''' (born September 9, 1993 in [[Maracaibo]], [[Venezuela]]) is a former [[Venezuela]]n [[Freestyle Football|football freestyler]].

==Background==
From the age of five, John started showing interest in football (soccer) when his father enrolled him in a local team for youngsters in La Azulita, Estado Mérida, Venezuela. While on the local team, he played as a mid-fielder and later on as a forward.
When John was 13, he was injured playing a friendly football match in his school; as a result, he suffered a partial tear in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. During his six months of healing, he discovered a new sport, known as freestyle football. From then, he was attracted to the sport, although few in Venezuela knew so at the time. After recuperating from his knee injury, John started practicing about 4–5 hours per day. He stopped playing football and concentrated on improving his touch and control of the ball. After 5 months of dedicated practice, he entered a national competition in Caracas, Venezuela, "The Red Bull Street Style Caracas 2008". Winning four rounds, Acquaviva went up against the previous year's champion before losing the final in a split 2-1 decision.

According to John, his injury motivated him to continue practicing freestyle, in spite of influence from others telling him to continue football and that freestyle was 'a waste of time'. In 2009, when he found that Red Bull had organized an online video competition, John entered the competition. Two weeks thereafter, Acquaviva was nominated the winner of the competition with the majority of votes. In August 2011, John participated in the Freestyle Football World Championship in Prague. Upon qualifying for the semifinals, he was defeated by later World Champion Szymon Skalski ("Szymo") at the championship. Currently, John is ranked among the top 30 freestyle footballers internationally.

In March 2012, John was named an 'Olympic Torch Bearer' upon been nominated as a Future Flame on the [[Coca-Cola|Coca]] Cola website, John was the first freestyler to ever be involved with the Olympics. On his mother's side, John is half British. He spent some of his childhood in [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]], [[England]] and is currently living in [[England]].
