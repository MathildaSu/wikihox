==Quotes==
"I've watched my favorite local record store shutdown after 10+ years of operation and dozens of purchases. For me, there is a big emotional connection between the purchase and first play of a record. I own a lot of music and most of it tells a story of how I found it and what part of my life it relates to. The quest for new and exciting music is only possible at a place where true talent influences the records that are being pushed. For myself, I tour all over the world and make a point to hunt down an indie store in as many places as I can. There is nothing more self-gratifying than discovering a store and making a rare purchase of something you have been searching for." - Paul Koehler
