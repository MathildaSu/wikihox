'''HousingAnywhere.com''' is an international online [[housing]] platform that focuses on the student housing market. The [[Rotterdam]] based [[Startup company|start-up]] was founded in 2009 by a group of [[Student|students]] including the primary founder [[Niels van Deuren]] at the [[Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University|Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://startupjuncture.com/2015/11/18/founder-niels-van-deuren-on-housing-anywheres-recipe-for-success-i-believe-in-focus-video/|title=Founder Niels van Deuren on Housing Anywhere’s recipe for success: ‘I believe in focus’ [video]|last=Saberi|first=Samir|date=2015-11-18|website=StartupJuncture|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>. 

== Company History ==
The student initiative Housing Anywhere (HousingAnywhere / HousingAnywhere.com) was conceptualised and introduced back in 2009. The initiative developed from a small [[student]] project to a [[global]] platform<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://magnet.me/a/company/housinganywhere/about?lang=en|title=About HousingAnywhere.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Magnet.me|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>. It all began in 2009 when the founder, Niels van Deuren, was studying for a degree in International Business Administration at the [[Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University|Rotterdam School of Management]]. Included in his studies was a semester abroad at the [[National University of Singapore]], through which he realised a problem and a gap in the market of student housing<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2014/10/12/going-dutch-sharing-economy-turns-student-project-into-a-global-business/#33efb7235631|title=Going Dutch: Sharing Economy Turns Student Project Into A Global Business|last=Coleman|first=Alison|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>. Van Deuren noticed the struggle to find housing in [[Singapore]], and in the meantime, also trying to sublet his room in [[Rotterdam]], and through this experience, the company Housing Anywhere was born<ref name=":0" />. 

=== Growth and International expansion ===
Starting off on a small scale by seeking partnerships with [[Dutch]] universities, through which the [[university]] would promote the platform to their [[Student|students]], Housing Anywhere began to grow<ref name=":0" />. In 2011, the online platform began to expand internationally, by becoming active in some the main [[European]] [[countries]], including [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Denmark]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.henq.nl/portfolio/housinganywhere/|title=Housing Anywhere - henQ|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref>. By the end of 2014 and in 2015, Housing Anywhere began operating, through partnerships with universities, in countries outside of [[Europe]], including [[Brazil]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.eusoufamecos.net/pucrs-firma-convenio-de-housing-internacional/|title=PUCRS firma convênio de housing internacional {{!}} Eu Sou Famecos|last=|first=|date=|website=portal.eusoufamecos.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref>, [[Mexico]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uach.mx/noticias/2015/09/23/housing_anywhere/|title=Housing Anywhere Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua|last=Chihuahua|first=Universidad Autónoma de|date=|website=www.uach.mx|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref>, and the [[United States]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://summer.berkeley.edu/student-services/student-housing/non-ucb-housing-options|title=Housing options not affiliated with UCB {{!}} Berkeley Summer Sessions|last=|first=|date=|website=summer.berkeley.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref>. 

Currently Housing Anywhere is partnered with 120+ universities [[world wide]], active in 118, 500+ [[cities]], and offers more than 90,000 [[Room|rooms]] on the platform<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://housinganywhere.com/|title=Housing Anywhere|website=HousingAnywhere|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esnvalenciaupv.es/news/new-partner-housinganywhere|title=New Partner! HousingAnywhere {{!}} ESN Valencia UPV|website=esnvalenciaupv.es|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref>.

== Funding and Investments ==
In it’s infant stage, Housing Anywhere was solely funded by the subscription fee which, universities paid for a [[membership]]<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mt.nl/646/gamechangers-2015-lijst/list/1353-housing-anywhere.html|title=Housing Anywhere|last=|first=|date=|website=MT.nl|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref>. In 2012, when Housing Anywhere began to grow rapidly, there was a need for more staff, and the founder, Van Deuren, experienced his first [[cash flow]] issues<ref name=":0" />. This led to their first funding round, in which Van Deuren raised €150,000<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/dft/ondernemen/startervandeweek/24112732/__Woonruimte_in_21_landen__.html|title=HousingAnywhere.com geeft studenten 'n dak boven hun hoofd|last=|first=|date=2015-06-03|website=Telegraaf|publisher=|language=nl-NL|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref>. In February 2015, Housing Anywhere received a 1 million dollar investment from [[henQ Invest]] and two other investors<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://startupjuncture.com/2015/02/11/rental-startup-housing-anywhere-secures-1-million/|title=Rental startup Housing Anywhere secures $1 million|last=|first=|date=2015-02-11|website=StartupJuncture|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref>. By the end of 2016, the company hopes to raise 3 million euros via [[Venture capital|Venture Capital]]<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/dft/ondernemen/hoeishetnumet/25773982/__Hoe_is_het_nu_met..._Housing_Anywhere___.html|title=Hoe is het nu met...

== Concept, Product & Business Model ==
The [[business model]] of Housing Anywhere is based on the [[sharing economy]]<ref name=":1" />. Students going [[Study abroad|abroad]], leaving an empty room in the city of their home university can advertise their room on the website, and students looking for a place can rent out these rooms via the platform<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marseille.ixesn.fr/news/retrouvez-housing-anywhere-%25C3%25A0-marseille|title=News|last=|first=|date=|website=ESN Marseille|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref>. Additionally, by establishing partnerships with universities all over the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://housinganywhere.com/universities|title=Information for Universities|last=|first=|date=|website=HousingAnywhere|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>, Housing Anywhere is able to create a [[network]], in which the platform asks for a subscription or membership fee to join the network. Lastly, although using the platform is free for students<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wu.ac.at/en/programs/incoming-students/exchange-semester/accommodation/private-accommodation/|title=Private Accommodation - Housing Anywhere|last=|first=|date=|website=WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business)|publisher=|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref>, when booking an [[accommodation]], Housing Anywhere charges a booking fee, for using their secure booking system<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://angel.co/housinganywhere-com-2|title=HousingAnywhere.com|last=|first=|date=|website=angel.co|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref><ref name=":1" />. This booking system includes a ‘not good, money back’ guarantee<ref name=":3" />, as a way to deal with [[scammers]] that might be on the platform. 

== Competitive Industry ==
Housing Anywhere is often referred to as the [[Airbnb]] for short/mid-long term student [[housing]]<ref name=":0" />. What differentiates the two however, is their focus in the [[market]]. While Housing Anywhere focuses on longer term accommodation for students and more specifically [[International student|international students]], Airbnb focuses on [[vacation]] rental homes for shorter stay<ref name=":0" />.  

Being what some might call a [[pioneer]] in the [[online]] student [[housing]] market, with a focus on international students<ref name=":2" />, Housing Anywhere has set an example and started a [[trend]] which many other [[Startup company|start-ups]] have now followed. These other start-ups include, [[nestpick]], [[Uniplaces]], and [[ErasmusInn]]<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.owler.com/iaApp/2680018/housinganywhere-competitors?onBoardingComplete=true|title=HousingAnywhere Company Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=www.owler.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref>. Among the competitors focusing on local students are [[Kamernet]], [[Wg-gesucht.de]], [[Spotahome]], and more<ref name=":4" />.
