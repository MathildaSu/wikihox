'''Novara Media''' is a London-based new media organisation with a specific focus on politics and current affairs. Its mission statement is to create a "new media for a different politics". It was started in June 2011 by Aaron Bastani, initially as an hour-long radio show broadcast weekly on London's [[ResonanceFM]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = New weekly Resonance FM show will discuss politics, activism and social change|url = https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/aaron-peters/new-weekly-resonance-fm-show-will-discuss-politics-activism-and-social-chang|website = openDemocracy|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> The weekly show remains central in Novara's output and is now known as NovaraFM with Bastani joined by co-hosts James Butler, co-founder of Novara, and Ash Sarkar.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Support Novara Media|url = http://support.novaramedia.com/|website = Novara Media|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}</ref>

In 2013 Novara Media expanded into video with the launch of NovaraTV. Early the following year Novara launched it popular blogging site Novara Wire.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Novara Wire|url = http://wire.novaramedia.com/|website = Novara Wire|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}</ref> One of the major ideas that Novara has popularised is "Fully Automated Luxury Communism",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fully automated luxury communism|url = http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/18/fully-automated-luxury-communism-robots-employment|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-03|first = Brian|last = Merchant}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = We Don't Need More Austerity: We Need Luxury Communism {{!}} VICE {{!}} United Kingdom|url = http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/luxury-communism-933|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}</ref> a set of propositions which aim at the consistent reduction of working hours, while increasing leisure time, through the increased application of [[automation]] within a [[post-capitalist]] set of values.

In 2015 the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] referred to Novara Media as a key example of an innovative website providing alternative commentary on British politics.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPPR Report: "The democracy commission: Reforming democracy to combat political inequality" |url= http://www.ippr.org/read/the-democracy-commission-reforming-democracy-to-combat-political-inequality#reviving-our-democracy-addressing-political-inequality | accessdate = August 26, 2015 }}</ref> At present Novara is a non-profit, running on donations.

== NovaraFM ==
NovaraFM, is described by Resonance as a "discussion show dedicated to political theory, current affairs".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Resonance FM|url = https://www.resonancefm.com/programmes/558d773650000b8db200002d|website = www.resonancefm.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}</ref> Guests have included [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = In Conversation with Owen Jones: The Demonisation of the Labour Party|url = http://novaramedia.com/2013/09/in-conversation-with-owen-jones-the-demonisation-of-the-labour-party/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = ‘Why It’s (Still) Kicking Off Everywhere’ – In Conversation With Paul Mason|url = http://novaramedia.com/2013/02/why-its-still-kicking-off-everywhere-in-conversation-with-paul-mason/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> [[Laurie Penny]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = On ‘Columnism’ in Discussion with Laurie Penny|url = http://novaramedia.com/2013/01/on-columnism/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref>[[Melissa Gira Grant]], [[David Graeber]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Shlomo Sand]] and [[David Harvey]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Contradictions of Capitalism: In Conversation with David Harvey|url = http://novaramedia.com/2014/04/contradictions-of-capitalism-in-conversation-with-david-harvey/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref>

In January 2013 NovaraFM was praised in the [[London Review of Books]] after their analysis of the corporate tax avoidance of high-street cafés like [[Starbucks]] and [[Pret a Manger]]. Editor Paul Myerscough wrote: "Novara is a gratifyingly apocalyptic counterweight to a BBC political news operation whose pivot, around which it maintains its sacred ‘balance’, has drifted, as if on the tide of parliamentary party politics, incrementally to the right".<ref>{{Cite news|title = Short Cuts|url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n01/paul-myerscough/short-cuts|newspaper = London Review of Books|date = 2013-01-03|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 0260-9592|pages = 25|first = Paul|last = Myerscough}}</ref>

== NovaraWire ==
Beginning in February 2014 Novara Wire has published several hundred articles, generally formatted as bite sized 'list-icles' leading to it being referred to as "the [[BuzzFeed]] of the Left".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Institutionalised Political Correctness is a dangerous myth {{!}} The Multicultural Politic|url = http://www.tmponline.org/2014/09/16/rotherham-racism-abuse/|website = www.tmponline.org|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> It has received over half a million unique readers in its first 18 months and has published pieces by [[Natalie Bennett]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Natalie Bennett: We Need a New Economic Model|url = http://wire.novaramedia.com/2014/10/we-need-a-new-economic-model/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> [[Aaron Bastani]] and James Meadway of the [[New Economics Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = 6 Reasons Jeremy Corbyn Could Win the Next General Election|url = http://wire.novaramedia.com/2015/07/6-reasons-jeremy-corbyn-could-win-the-next-general-election/|website = Novara Wire|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref>

== NovaraTV ==
Novara Media has published video interviews with a range of politicians including Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Interview: Jeremy Corbyn|url = http://novaramedia.com/2015/07/interview-jeremy-corbyn/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> during his ultimately successful leadership campaign, Green MP [[Caroline Lucas]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Interview: Caroline Lucas|url = http://novaramedia.com/2015/09/interview-caroline-lucas/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> Green leader [[Natalie Bennett]] and the independent Tower Hamlets councillor [[Rabina Khan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rabina Khan Interview|url = http://novaramedia.com/2015/05/rabina-khan-interview/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref>

NovaraTV's interview with Jeremy Corbyn was referenced widely in the media due to Corbyn stating that he would be open to forming an alliance with the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] if Labour couldn't achieve a majority in the 2020 general election.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Jeremy Corbyn has welcomed an SNP pact - as they both vow to axe nuclear bombs|url = http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-welcomes-snp-pact-6206359|website = Daily Mirror|accessdate = 2015-10-03|first = Dan|last = Bloom}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = I would do a deal with the SNP to get into power|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3186430/I-deal-SNP-power-Left-wing-leadership-candidate-says-work-party-2020-election-day-day-basis.html|website = Daily Mail|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> As a result Bastani appeared in discussions about the Corbyn campaign on [[CNBC]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Corbyn: Man of the millennials?|url = http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000408137|website = CNBC|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref> [[Channel 4 News]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Labour entryists: the left activists joining to back Corbyn|url = http://www.channel4.com/news/corbyn-is-a-game-changer-for-the-left|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}</ref> and [[Sky News]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Aaron Bastani on Sky News on Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWdrzC0E98A|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}</ref>
