'''David Letele''' (born September 9, 1979, [[Auckland, New Zealand]]) also known as the Brown Buttabean, is a [[New Zealand]] professional heavyweight boxer.

Letele was an accomplished corporate boxer fighting multiple times on Duco Event's card before turning pro. Letele puts on a character while in front of media and in the ring called the Brown Buttabean inspired by [[Eric Esch]]'s Butterbean. Letele has gotten mixed reactions from the media and the general public, calling him Ducos Circus act.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|author=Liam Napier |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/10032281/Brown-Butterbean-Letele-ready-to-drop-bombs |title='Brown Butterbean' Letele ready to drop bombs |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2014-05-11 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> Despite the mixed reaction Letele still works and trains hard.

==Duco Event's Corporate World Title==

Duco Event's created their own title, which is the exact replica from the [[Rocky (film series)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ducoboxing/videos/vb.120145078078373/697978736961668/ |title=Duco Boxing - Brown Buttabean Boxing Announcement |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> With this title Letele puts out an open challenge to the locals to fight him at 4x2 minute rounds at a weight limit of 100&nbsp;kg. The added stipulation is that if Leteles opponent knocks him out, they will receive ten thousand dollars.

Letele won the title against John Lomu (who is the brother of [[Jonah Lomu]]) on 16 October 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/archive/joseph-parker-wins-by-unanimous-decision-6109375 |title=Joseph Parker wins by unanimous decision |publisher=Tvnz.co.nz |date=2014-10-16 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> Letele won by TKO in the second round.

Letele defended his title for the second time against [[Waikato Rugby Union]] Prop Loni Uhila on 6 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/sport/video-highlights-letele-defeats-uhila---fight-for-life-2014120621#axzz3nrSdRnxe |title=Video highlights: Letele defeats Uhila Fight for life &#124; Sport |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> Letele won by SD event though allot of people thought Uhila won. The NZPBA recognize Leteles fights from here onwards as professional fights and not corporate, fights even though the rules stayed at corporate rules.

Letele defended the title for the third time against former [[Tonga national rugby union team]] star [[Finau Maka]] on 5 March 2015. Letele won by TKO in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/archive/as-it-happened-joseph-parker-v-jason-pettaway-6248569 |title=As It Happened: Joseph Parker v Jason Pettaway |publisher=TVNZ |date= |accessdate=2015-10-14}}</ref>

Letele defended his title for the forth and fifth time by fighting two people on the same night. This was the only time NZPBA did not recognize Letele's fights as pro bouts since fighting Loni Uhila. The NZPBA did not recognizes the two bouts as pro due to both bouts didn't make minimum scheduled time limit of either 4x2 minute rounds or 3x3 minute rounds. Both of the bouts were scheduled for 3x2 minute rounds. Letele fought the winner of the Christchurch Corporate Boxing Tournament Jae Jae Smith and local Lordly Kaihua. Letele won both bouts in the third round by TKO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/sport/video-live-updates--joseph-parker-vs-yakup-the-scorpion-saglam-2015061319 |title=Video live updates: Joseph Parker vs Yakup 'The Scorpion' Saglam &#124; Sport |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref>

Letele defended his title for the sixth and final time on 1 August 2015 against former [[Southland Rugby Football Union]] player Kaleni Taetuli. Letele lost the bout in 22 second in the first round by TKO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/70748833/Novice-boxer-Kaleni-Taetuli-floors-Brown-Buttabean-to-earn-knockout-bonus |title=Novice boxer Kaleni Taetuli floors Brown Buttabean to earn knockout bonus |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2015-08-01 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref>

Kaleni Taetuli defended the title against Letele on 15 October. If Taetuli won by knockout, he would have received fifteen thousand dollars instead of the usual ten thousand dollar stipulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/70748774/kaleni-taetuli-wants-to-ko-brown-buttabean-dave-letele-again |title=Kaleni Taetuli wants to KO 'Brown Buttabean' Dave Letele again |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> It has been reported that win, lose or draw this will be Taetuli's last fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/71264640/Southlands-Kaleni-Taetuli-has-no-desire-to-keep-boxing-after-Buttabean-rematch |title=Southland's Kaleni Taetuli has no desire to keep boxing after Buttabean rematch |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2015-08-19 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> Letele won the fight by majority decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/sport/other/desperate-brown-buttabean-works-overtime-to-win-rematch-avid-060a2b340101010501010f1013-000000-e3ed1f4ad8df0094-fe340060dd44-a8b1|title=Desperate Brown Buttabean works overtime to win rematch |publisher=One News |date=2015-10-15 |accessdate=2015-10-16}}</ref>

==Weight loss motivation==
Letele has lost over 70&nbsp;kg by March 2014. His weight loss inspired him to help others out by supporting and educating everyday people on their health and wellness journey. At first it was only a Facebook group that Letele created which has reached over 4000 and growing everyday. Letele's aim is to help 5000 people by the end of 2015 by supporting them in releasing a combined weight of 25,000&nbsp;kg.

==Controversy==
On 4 March 2015, the day before his fight against [[Finau Maka]] at the weigh in, both fighters got into a fight. Letele grabbed Maka on the throat pushing him back, Maka retaliated by tackling him to the ground, however the fight was broken off quickly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maoritelevision.com/news/sport/brown-buttabean-unleashes-maka-during-stand |title=Brown Buttabean unleashes on Maka during stand-off &#124; Māori Television |publisher=Maoritelevision.com |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref>

On 14 October 2015 the day before his second fight against Kaleni Taetuli at the weigh in, Letele lashed out and try to attack Taetuli while screaming out "You won the lottery last time". Leteles team grabbed him before he could get his hands onto Taetuli.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/sport/other/-you-won-the-lottery-last-time-buttabean-lashes-out-ahead-of-kaleni-taetuli-rematch-avid-060a2b340101010501010f1013-000000-c5d24220dddf0094-29680060dd44-a8b1|title=You won the lottery last time!' Buttabean lashes out ahead of Kaleni Taetuli rematch|publisher=One News |date=2015-10-14 |accessdate=2015-10-14}}</ref>

==Personal life==
From an early age he endured a uniquely tough upbringing. His father, Dave, joined the Mongrel Mob at just 13. Six years later, he became Auckland president. That troubled path led to six years in jail for armed robbery. Letele's uncle also spent half his life behind bars. Since their release they helped form a foundation - called Grace - to support families facing similar problems. But, at the time, Letele was forced to find his own way in the world. Not long ago Letele, who played professional rugby league in Australia and France, tipped the scales at a whopping 210&nbsp;kg. His weight blew out after suffering difficult, lonely times in Australia. The problems stemmed from taking on two supermarkets, only for finance to bottom out. Close friend and former Selwyn College classmate, Duco promoter David Higgins, was concerned about Letele's health and offered him a lifeline on Parker's undercard. Having moved back to Auckland he's now doing everything possible to support his three sons.<ref name="auto"/>
