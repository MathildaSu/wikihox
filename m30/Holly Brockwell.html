=== NHS sterilization denial ===
In 2012 Brockwell requested the ability to be [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilized]] from the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]]. She was denied due to her age,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34521525 |title=100 Women 2015: Desperate not to have children |date=2015-11-22|work=Magazine |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=2017-08-01 }}</ref> which according to the NHS is common practice because surgeons prefer to wait until prospective patients are at least 30 years of age and have had children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception-guide/pages/female-sterilisation.aspx#Who|title=Female sterilisation - Contraception guide |website=NHS Choices |publisher=National Health Service |access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref> At the end of March 2016, after turning 30, she was granted permission for the procedure.<ref>{{cite news |first=Holly |last=Blott |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3513800/Holly-Brockwell-reveals-happiness-wins-four-year-battle-sterilised-Morning.html |title=Woman, 30, defends being sterilised after winning four year battle with NHS |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |date=2016-03-29 }}</ref>

== Blogging and ''Gadgette'' ==
In 2012 Brockwell blogged about an advertising agency and its campaign about benefit schemes for their staff <ref>[https://hollybrockwell.com/2012/09/05/ad-agency-laughs-at-people-on-benefits/ Ad agency laughs at people on benefits by Holly Brockwell]</ref> which sparked controversy and negative publicity.<ref>[http://www.decisionmarketing.co.uk/news/iris-faces-uproar-over-chav-parody Iris faces uproar over ‘chav’ parody by Decision Marketing]</ref> The agency accused Brockwell of libel but later apologised.

The next year Brockwell sparked controversy again after writing about a 2013 [[Hyundai]] advert that was later withdrawn.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/hyundai-pulls-viral-zero-emission-car-ad-featuring-man-attempting-suicide-8588650.html Hyundai pulls viral zero emission car ad featuring man attempting suicide by [[The Independent]]],</ref>

In 2015 Brockwell started her own women’s tech site called ''Gadgette'' in order to tackle the apparent condescending and discriminating attitudes towards women in the technology industry. The launch of the website faced backlash, according to an op-ed by Brockwell.<ref>{{cite news |first=Holly |last=Brockwell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/jul/22/sexism-tech-industry-womens-site |title=I've been viciously attacked for daring to start a women's tech site |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |type=opinion |date=2015-07-22 }}</ref>
