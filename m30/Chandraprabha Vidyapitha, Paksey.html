== History ==
It was the early twentieth century. In that time [[Paksey]] was situated in Sara Police Station (current [[Ishwardi Upazila]]). Then [[Paksey]] and of the closest villages were particularly disadvantaged due lack of education. After being established the [[Hardinge Bridge]] over the  [[Padma River]] in 1916 [[Paksey]] was declared Railway division. In that time there was no educational opportunity for the children of railway service holders and local people. Mr. Yogindra Chandra Dasgupta came [[Paksey]] as the Inspector of Works of Railways. His major duty was to develop the infrastructure, roads and houses. He was promoted as a Senior Divisional Officer (SDO) and stayed at [[Paksey]]. Then there was a dense forest there where the Chandraprabha Viddyapitha is standing now. Once he came into the forest and saw two death bodies, were killed in a brutal way cutting off the neck and left to the forest two days before. He was shocked and told the sad news to his mother. His mother said,'' You make such an institution that will teach people how to repair the cutting throat instead of killing.’’ To obey his mother’s order Mr. Yogindra Chandra Dasgupta established Paksey High English School on 2 January 1924 with the cooperation of local learned people. In 1938 the school named as Chandraprabha Viddyapitha as the founder's mother name. In 1985 the school was taken by the railway authority and became governmental Institution. After that time the school renamed as the [[Bangladesh Railway]] Chandraprabha Vidyapitha, Paksey. It is an oldest and traditional renowned school in [[Pabna]] district.

This institution has been enlightening the power of knowledge to the people since 1924.
