==Anti-bullying campaign==
Healey initiated a global anti-bullying campaign in 2014, which is supported by Ricky Gervais, Katie Price, and Keith Duffy, among others.<ref name=dm-gervais>{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Rachel |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2318285/Make-online-bullying-illegal-Ricky-Gervais-Katie-Price-autistic-mans-campaign-stop-trolling-people-special-needs.html |title='Make online bullying illegal': Ricky Gervais and Katie Price back autistic man's campaign to stop trolling of people with special needs &#124; Daily Mail Online |work=[[The Daily Mail]] |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref><ref name=taa-2013>{{cite web|title=Autism and bullying with Kevin Healey|url=http://www.talkaboutautism.org.uk/page/liveevents/kevin_healey.cfm|website=Talk About Autism|accessdate=6 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206164655/http://www.talkaboutautism.org.uk/page/liveevents/kevin_healey.cfm|archivedate=2015-02-06|date=2013-08-14}}</ref> Healey has been the victim of cyberbullying and harassment on Twitter due to his activism.<ref name=adn-2013>{{cite news|last1=Worgan|first1=Jo|title=Kevin Healey Leading Autism Campaigner Launches Online Petition for Twitter Verification|url=http://www.autismdailynewscast.com/kevin-healey-leading-autism-campaigner-launches-online-petition-for-twitter-verification/5936/joworgan/|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=Autism Daily Newscast|date=2013-12-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418092135/http://www.autismdailynewscast.com/kevin-healey-leading-autism-campaigner-launches-online-petition-for-twitter-verification/5936/joworgan/|archivedate=2015-04-18}}</ref> This bullying included not only online harassment and cloning (impersonation) of his Twitter account, which had over 100,000 followers as of June 2015, but also threats to "sever [his] legs"<ref name=sentinel-2015/> or kill him. Taking into consideration the information that some of those bullying him had learned what neighbourhood he lived in, Healey found those threats credible enough that he did not leave his home for three months.<ref name=sentinel-2015/><ref name=dm-gervais/> His experiences motivated him to raise awareness about cyberbullying and online harassment of those with autism.<ref name=adn-2014>{{cite news|last1=Worgan|first1=Jo|title=Kevin Healey and his Anti Bullying Autism Campaign|url=http://www.autismdailynewscast.com/kevin-healey-and-his-anti-bullying-autism-campaign/6427/joworgan/|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=Autism Daily Newscast|date=2014-01-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206044156/http://www.autismdailynewscast.com/kevin-healey-and-his-anti-bullying-autism-campaign/6427/joworgan/|archivedate=2015-02-06}}</ref> Healey advocates for making the bullying of a person with a developmental disability a crime; as of 2015 bullying is not a crime under UK law, leaving victims little recourse.<ref name=sentinel-2015/>
