==Activism==
In 2012, Lopez lobbied for the 1992 death of [[Marsha P. Johnson]], a black transgender rights activist to be reexamined with modern technology. Initially the case was considered a suicide but in 2012 the NYPD re-opened the case as possible homicide.<ref>{{Cite web|title = DA reopens unsolved 1992 case involving the 'saint of gay life'|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/da-reopens-unsolved-1992-case-involving-saint-gay-life-article-1.1221742|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = 2015-06-15|date = 2012-12-16|first = Shayna|last = Jacobs}}</ref>

Lopez helped open the very first transgender housing unit for the largest prison in America, [[Rikers Island]] in 2014. She wrote on Facebook on July 30, 2014 that "the country's first exclusively transgender facility" would open within days.<ref>http://gaycitynews.nyc/rikers-jail-open-transgender-unit/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Rikers Island to offer separate housing for transgender inmates|url = http://nypost.com/2014/11/19/rikers-island-to-offer-separate-housing-for-transgender-inmates/|website = New York Post|date = 2014-11-19|accessdate = 2015-06-15|first = Kirstan|last = Conley}}</ref> The new unit would help better protect transgender individuals as Lopez stated the housing unit was in response to "abuses so severe and taboo, that most people (the general public and elected officials) believe these practices to be outlawed and or no longer practiced"; writing that "abuses included strip-searches by officers, beating and rape of trans individuals while incarcerated throughout the United States." citing Amnesty International's 2003 report, "Stonewalled".

In 2014, Lopez acted as a publicist with STARR when the Administration for Childrenâ€™s Services (ACS) of New York City offered gender reassignment surgery for a 21 year old, former foster care child. The city paid for the surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Exclusive: A sex change operation is funded by New York City's Administration for Children's Services|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-pays-sex-change-operation-article-1.1601167|website = Daily News New York|accessdate = 2015-06-15}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On June 17, 2006 Lopez was arrested for "loitering with intent for solicitation" by the New York Police Department. She was held on a one thousand fifteen hundred dollar bond, which she couldn't afford to pay. The abuse she endured while going through the prison was: being taken to a women's jail where she was ordered to do a 'genital check' for the officers to determine if she belonged there; when she refused they took her to a men's jail where she was denied her clothing, bra, and underwear, later being sexually harassed and assaulted by an inmate then assaulted by an officer.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.amnesty.org/.../amr511642006en.pdf|title = New York City: Abuse of Transgender Women
