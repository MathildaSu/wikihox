Que Peller learned the art of magic from his father, but his main interest was music. As a young boy, Que performed his songs, in the background during his father’s rehearsals and performances. Growing up Que was influenced by [[King Sunny Ade]], and [[Fela Anikulapo Kuti]] amongst other notable Nigerian artists. Although his family had a legacy in magic entertainment, Que’s interest were in the art of blending instruments and vocals, which would eventually lead him to peruse music.
