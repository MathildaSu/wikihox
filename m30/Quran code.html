The '''Quran code''' is a proposed mathematical structure within the text of the [[Quran]], mostly using the [[19 (number)|number 19]] as a [[common denominator]]. The study and results from this [[cipher]] have been popularized by the book ''The Quran: Final Testament'' by [[Rashad Khalifa]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran The Final Testament|isbn=978-1-890825-00-3|page=375}}</ref> The code is so vast, intricate, and complex that proponents say it shows that the Quran was not written by humans.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Visual Presentation of the Miracle|publisher=Islamic Productions|isbn=0934894302|page=3|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/front_matter.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref> Because of this, those who believe the code actually exists refer to it as the '''Mathematical Miracle of the Quran'''.

==Overview==
In 1968, Egyptian biochemist Rashad Khalifa began his translation of the Quran because he was not satisfied with any of the other translations at the time. He vowed to never move past a verse without understanding it. After completing chapter 1 within a week, He arrived at chapter 2:1 with the letters ALM. His lack of understanding of this verse caused him to statistically analyze the Quran with a computer. Over the course of several years this continued until January 1974 when he claimed he had discovered an intricate mathematical pattern when he placed the original Arabic text of the Quran into a computer. The intricate pattern was found to be divisible by a common denominator of the number 19, hence "code-19" is sometimes used to popularly describe Khalifa's work or the community of [[Qur'an alone]] Muslims who go by the name of the [[Submitters]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Submission Perspective|url=http://www.quranalone.com/SP/57_1989_09.pdf|website=QuranAlone|accessdate=8 October 2015}}</ref>

The foundation of the code is the Quran's first verse, "In the Name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful" (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم ) known as ''[[Basmala|Bismillah ArRahman ArRahim]]'', which consists of 19 Arabic letters.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran: The Visual Presentation of the Miracle|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact01.pdf|website=MasjidTucson.org}}</ref>

<!-- Commented out: [[File:Basmalah2.jpg|thumb|The opening statement, "Basmala", consisting of 19 letters]] -->
 
Its constituent words occur in the Quran consistently in multiples of 19:

*The first word "[[Arabic name#Ism|Ism]]" (Name) occurs 19 times.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran: Visual Presentation of the Miracle|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact14.pdf|website=Masjidtucson.org}}</ref>
*The second word "[[Allah]]" (God) occurs 2698 times (19x142).<ref>{{cite web|title=Quran Word Count for God|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/miracle/QuranWordCount_GOD.html|website=Masjid Tucson|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>
*The third word "[[Al-Rahman]]" (Most Gracious) 57 times, 19x3.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran: Visual Presentation of the Miracle|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact17.pdf|website=Masjid Tucson|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>
*The fourth word "[[Rahman (Islamic term)|Al-Rahim]]" (Most Merciful) 114 times, 19x6.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran: Visual Presentation of the Miracle|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact18.pdf|website=MasjidTucson.org|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>

The Quran's 19 code, however, is not limited to the first verse only. Historically, the first chapter ever revealed to Muhammed was chapter 96, The Embryo. This chapter contains 19 verses. The first portion revealed consisted of what is now the first 5 verses. These include 19 words which comprise 76 letters (19x4). The whole chapter contains 304 letters, or 19x16. If you do not include the Basmalah, it is 285 letters which is 19x15.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran: Visual Presentation of the Miracle|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact07.pdf|website=MasjidTucson}}</ref>

Additionally, 29 chapters in the Quran are initialed by letters which prefix the chapters in which they occur. The letters in these chapters also conform to the mathematical system based on the number 19. For example, the total frequency of the letter "Q" in Chapter 50 is 57 or 19x3.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran: The visual presentation of the Miracle|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/publications/books/vp/fact23.pdf|website=MasjidTucson}}</ref>

List of the Quranic Initials and their chapters:

Chapter Number	Chaper Title	Quranic Initials

1.	2	The Heifer	A.L.M.

2.	3	The Amramites	A.L.M.

3.	7	The Purgatory	A.L.M.S.

4.	10	Jonah	A.L.R.

5.	11	Hud	A.L.R.

6.	12	Joseph	A.L.R.

6.	13	Thunder	A.L.M.R.

8.	14	Abraham	A.L.R.

27.	46	The Dunes	H.M.

28.	50	Q.	Q.

29.	68	The Pen	NuN

There is also interlocking relationships between the initialed chapters and their letters. For example, the letter S prefixes chapters 7, 19, and 38. The total frequency of this letter in these chapters is 152 or 19x8. This is in addition to, for example, this letter being part of the initialed set of KHYAS prefixing chapter 19 and the total occurrence of those letters within chapter 19 a total of 798 times which is 19x42.

==Organizational structure==
The Quran is said{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to have a complex overarching mathematical structure based on the number 19.
Some examples include the following:

The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or	19 x 334.
[6234 numbered verses & 112 un-numbered verses (Basmalahs) 6234+112 = 6346] Note that 6+3+4+6=	19.
The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) & 114=	19 x 6.
From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27, there are precisely	19 suras.
It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 (9+10+11+12+...+26+27) is 342, or	19 x 18.
This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmalahs of Sura 27, and 342 =	19 x 18.
The famous first revelation (96:1-5) consists of	19 words.
This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters	19 x 4.
Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of	19 verses.
This first chronological sura is placed atop the last	19 suras.
Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters, and 304 equals	19 x 16.
The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of	19 words.
The first verse of the last revelation (110:1) consists of	19 letters.
14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of “Quranic Initials” (such as A.L.M. of 2:1), and prefix 29 suras. These numbers add up to 14+14+29=57=	19 x 3.
The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic Initials occur is 2+3+7+...+50+68 = 822, and 822+14 (14 sets of initials) equals 836, or	19 x 44.
Between the first initialed sura (Sura 2) and the last initialed sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras	19 x 2.
Between the first and last initialed sura there are	19 sets
of alternating “initialed” and “uninitialed” suras.	
The Quran mentions 30 different numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 99, 100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162146, which equals 19x8534.

In addition to Mathematical aspects of the literary aspects of the Quran. There are also allegedly other dimensions to this system. It is said, for example, that when recited, the first chapter of the Quran known as "The Key", results in the lips touching a total of 19 times on the letters B and M. 15 letter M's occur and 4 letter B's. Additionally, it has been observed that based on gematrical values used during the time of the Quran and prior, B has a value of 2 and M has a value of 40. The total sum of these 19 occurrences thus comes out to 608 or 19x32.

==Mathematical structure ==

Traditionally, five pillars have been identified.

They include:

# Proclamation of Faith (Shahada)
# Contact Prayer (Salat)
# Fasting (Seyyawm)
# Obligatory Charity (Zakat)
# Pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj)

Each of these five is said to be supported by the mathematical code in the Quran:

* The word “ONE” that refers to God occurs in the Quran 19 times. The reference to God “ALONE” occurs 5 times, and the sum of the sura and verse numbers where we find these five occurrences is 361, 19x19. Additionally, the phrase in 3:18, “Lâ ilâha illâ huwa” (There is no other god besides Him) occurs in 19 suras.
*The word for Contact Prayer, “Salat“, occurs in the Quran 67 times, and when we add the numbers of suras and verses of these 67 occurrences, the total comes to 4674, or 19x246.
* The commandment to fast is mentioned in 2:183, 184, 185, 187, 196; 4:92; 5:89, 95; 33:35, 35; & 58:4. The total of these numbers is 1387, or 19x73. It is noteworthy that 33:35 mentions fasting twice, one for the believing men, and the other for the believing women.
* Zakat and Hajj are decreed only for those who can afford them. This explains the interesting mathematical phenomenon associated with Zakat and Hajj. The Zakat charity is mentioned in 2:43, 83, 110, 177, 277; 4:77, 162; 5:12, 55, 7:156; 9:5, 11, 18, 71; 18:81; 19:13, 31, 55; 21:73; 22:41, 78; 23:4; 24:37, 56; 27:3; 30:39; 31:4; 33:33; 41:7; 58:13; 73:20; and 98:5. These numbers add up to 2395. This total does not quite make it as a multiple of 19; it is up by 1.
* The Hajj Pilgrimage occurs in 2:189, 196, 197; 9:3; and 22:27. These numbers add up to 645, and this total does not quite make it as a multiple of 19; it is down by 1. Thus, Zakat and Hajj, together, give a total of 2395+645 = 3040 = 19x160.

==History==
This discovery received wide publicity throughout the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} By the end of 1973, Rashad Khalifa had become well known in circles, commanding full-house audiences as he lectured at universities, mosques, organizations, and even royal and presidential palaces.<ref>{{cite news|title=The world of Islam and Interpretations with an electronic brain|url=https://islamicmisconceptions.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/miracle-of-bismillah-19-digit/|accessdate=9 October 2015|agency=Iran News Agency|issue=Page 5|publisher=Etelaat Newspaper|date=January 31, 1972}}</ref>

In Appendix 1 of his book, Rashad mentioned that the 19-based code is seen intact in some Jewish tradition such as [[Shacharit|Jewish morning prayers]] as discovered by Rabbi [[Judah HeHasid|Judah the Pious]] and gave more details of this in his August 1985 article. Verse 46:10 is understood to be in reference to the Rabbi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quranalone.com/SP/07_1985_08.pdf|title=Mathematical Code of Qur’an Found in Previous Scripture|work=quranalone.com|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref> Some claim Rashad Khalifa made mistakes in his counting of the letters. They say this was human error and he revised his calculations numerous times. This idea was initially brought forth by Rashad's brother, Atef Khalifa.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Atef|url=http://submission.org/verify_count_of_Alif_and_Hamza.html|website=Submission.org|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref> Since Atef's death due to cancer in the early 2000s, his wife Basmah has continued with this understanding at Submission.org.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://submission.org/verify_Rashads_four_published_counts.html|title=Rashad's four published counts of the Quranic initials, Four different times. - Submission.org - Your best source for Submission (Islam)|work=submission.org|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref> Other groups, such as those still operating MasjidTucson.org for the masjid in Tucson, Arizona that Rashad personally lead, dispute claims of him miscounting. Regardless, Rashad opened up a field for discussion and there are now many websites exploring numerical aspects of the Quran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.7ameem.com|title=Numerical Analysis of Holy Quran|work=7ameem.com|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>

However, his claims led to conclusions that unavoidably run contrary to the beliefs of mainstream [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khalifa|first1=Rashad|title=Quran The Final Testament|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix33.html}}</ref> Khalifa also presented findings that
* All believers can be redeemed, regardless of the name of their religion (he also showed this throughout his translation)[Quran 2:62];
* Quran was all you need for salvation;
* [[Muhammad]] followed Abraham’s religion [Quran 16:123]: Monotheism, or more specifically "Submission" [Quran 22:78];
* Sincere believers have access to the understanding of the Quran, regardless of their mother tongue; disbelievers, on the other hand, will not be permitted by God to correctly understand the Quran, even if they are professors of the Arabic language.<ref>also dealt with in his Appendix: [http://www.submission.info/quran/appendices/appendix20.html Quran: Unlike Any Other Book]</ref>
