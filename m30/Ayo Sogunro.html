'''Ayodele Olorunfunmi Sogunro''' ([[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], known as '''Ayọ Sogunro''' (born 26 November 1984) is a Nigerian social critic, human rights activist and writer. He is notable as an essayist and satirist with right-wing libertarian tendencies. He is also the author of the book: ''The Wonderful Life of Senator Boniface and other Sorry Tales'', a collection of short stories which was a favourite of the Nigerian [[social media]] circles.

== Background ==
Sogunro was born into a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] family in [[Abeokuta]] in [[Ogun State]] of modern day Nigeria. He attended a local high school in his hometown for his secondary education between 1994 and 2000 before relocating to Lagos in 2002 to study Law at the [[University of Lagos]] which was where the foundations for his social criticism and human rights activism were laid. After his professional qualification at the [[Nigerian Law School]] in 2008 and the completion of the mandatory national service in 2009, he worked as a commercial lawyer in Lagos law firm, while actively engaging the Nigerian public on social and political issues.

== Works ==
In 2004, at 19, Sogunro's first book: ''Cracks in the Ivory Tower'', was published. The book was co-authored by his friend and collaborator, Goke Gbadamosi. A collection of short stories about university life, the book had limited publicity and no reviews. Only a few copies were sold before it eventually went out of print.

In 2012, a playlet he had written while in university, ''Death in the Dawn'' was published.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ayo Sogunro |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17740090-death-in-the-dawn |title=Death in the Dawn by Ayo Sogunro – Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> The play, which was inspired by a [[Wole Soyinka]] poem of the same title, satirised Nigerian society and the interactions between members of the society. The play was given an average rating by reviewers, but was also praised for its message.<ref>{{cite web|last=Okunlola|first=Omotola|title=Book Review: Death in the Dawn|url=http://1pageweekly.com/book-review-death-in-the-dawn/|publisher=1pageweekly.com}}</ref>
In 2013, Ayo Sogunro's first full length work, ''The Wonderful Life of Senator Boniface and other Sorry Tales'' was published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Wonderful-Senator-Boniface-other-Sorry/dp/9789340761/ |title=The Wonderful Life of Senator Boniface and other Sorry Tales: Ayo Sogunro: 9789789340767: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> The book was an instant favourite on Nigerian social media circles, generating the [[hashtag]] #SorryTales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SorryTales&src=typd |title=Twitter / Zoeken – #SorryTales |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> "Sorry Tales" as it is familiarly called, is a collection of fourteen contemporary short stories, interspersed with poetry, exploring themes of human nature in general, and Nigerian social psychology in particular. The book received generally positive reviews, and according to a reviewer: {{cquote|Ayo Sogunro delved into his repertoire of unlimited humour, sarcasm, realism, and politics of our everyday life, woven with such deftness and clarity of thought that allows you move along different literary gears seamlessly, dotting it with the vast knowledge amassed on different fields of endeavour. Despite his carefree preface, he cares deeply for Nigeria, touching almost every theme that has become a recurring heartache in our national life and yet, he never veered from the entertainment he specifically promised.<ref>{{cite web|author=Debo Adejugbe |url=http://afrisphere.com/ayo-sogunro-compiles-our-sorry-tales-a-review-by-debo-adejugbe/ |title=Ayo Sogunro Compiles Our Sorry Tales |publisher=Afrisphere.com |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>}} The book has been described as a modern addition to the works of Wole Soyinka, [[Cyprian Ekwensi]] and other celebrated Nigerian writers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tejiri|first=Oghenekaro|title=A Review of Ayo Sogunro's Sorry Tales|url=http://omojuwa.com/2013/11/a-review-of-ayo-sogunros-sorry-tales-a-collection-of-short-stories-by-tj-okaro|publisher=Omojuwa.com}}</ref>

== Activism and Controversies ==
Sogunro is known for tackling critical issues in Nigeria through essays, poetry and stories. A right-wing libertarian, he is a frequent commentator on socio-political issues in both Nigerian and international media. A number of his works are directly accessible on his personal blog, ''ayosogunro.com''.

A self professed philosopher, Sogunro's writings generally encapsulate his views on socio-political interactions, spanning themes of liberty, limited government, secular humanism, separation of religion and state, and individualism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Channels TV Book Club|title=Interview with Ayo Sogunro|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCe5J_2s8IM|publisher=Channels Television|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=1pageweekly |url=http://1pageweekly.com/1pwinterview-with-ayo-sogunro-ayosogunro/ |title=Interview With Ayo Sogunro |publisher=1pageweekly.com |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref> He was a vocal supporter of the Occupy Nigeria movement in 2012, and actively called for widespread participation in the protests and in which he also participated physically.

He has been a staunch critic of the [[Goodluck Jonathan]] administration in Nigeria, first by actively campaigning against the election of the president in the 2011 elections, and then later critiquing several policy decisions of the administration. After an article by [[Reuben Abati]] defending the character of the president was published in August 2012, Sogunro wrote a rejoinder article that went [[viral]], and in which he gave scathing remarks against the antics of the president's advisers while highlighting the expectations from the Jonathan administration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sogunro|first=Ayo|title=The Nigerians They Don't Give A Damn About|url=http://ayosogunro.com/2012/08/28/the-nigerians-they-dont-give-a-damn-about-a-rejoinder-by-ayo-sogunro}}</ref> Sogunro is known for his satirical writings on controversial topics, and he has been a steady critic of overzealous spirituality in Nigeria, especially the Pentecostal Christians in the South of Nigeria and the radical Muslims in the North.<ref>{{cite web|title=Being Gay in Nigeria Now Means Arrest, Prison|url=https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/01/17/being-gay-in-nigeria-now-means-arrest-prison/|publisher=Global Voices|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> Other issues which Sogunro has tackled include police and army recklessness in Nigeria, especially after the killing of students of Nasarawa State University in February 2013, and recently, American conservative elements. He has also advocated for constitutional education and reform and has spoken consistently on the need to educate Nigerians on basic constitutional rights and obligations.

In 2013, after the Nigerian legislature approved the passage of an anti-gay bill, Sogunro intervened in the sexual rights advocacy,<ref>{{cite web|last=Famutimi|first=Temitayo|title=Accolades, rebuke trail anti-gay law|url=http://www.punchng.com/i-punch/accolades-rebuke-trail-anti-gay-law/|publisher=Punch Nigeria Newspaper|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> firmly criticising the actions of the legislature<ref>{{cite web|last=Omisore|first=Bolanle|title=Nigeria Legislates Against Gay Marriage|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/nigeria-legislates-against-gay-marriage-777#axzz2pQYGUvW7|publisher=ebony.com}}</ref> and calling on Nigerians to be more tolerable of sexual differences,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nigeria clamps down on same-sex marriage|url=http://stream2398cdn.aljazeera.com/story/201306032206-0022800|publisher=Aljazeera.com}}</ref> a stance that has been unpopular with the generally homophobic Nigerian society. In furtherance of his human rights conviction, he was also involved in the documentary "Veil of Silence" which is geared at educating Nigerians on sexual and human rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Habeeb Lawal's Veil of Silence Calls For LGBT Equal Rights in Nigeria|url=http://www.veestaonline.com/movies/new-stuff/item/433-trailerhabeeb-lawals-veil-of-silence-calls-for-lgbt-equal-rights-in-nigeria|publisher=veestaonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ade Bantu, Dorothy Aken'Ova, Wole Ojo, Zaina, Ayo Sogunro, Ann Njemanze and others step out for Veil of Silence Special Screening in Lagos|url=http://tiers4equality.blogspot.com/2014/01/ade-bantu-dorothy-akenova-wole-ojo.html|publisher=TIERS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ayo Sogunro IMDB Page|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6011428/|publisher=imdb.com}}</ref>

In April 2014, Ayo Sogunro, along with Fola Lawal and others commenced the #FreeCiaxon online campaign to pressure the Nigerian government to release Siyaka Onimisi who had been surreptitiously detained for live-tweeting pictures of a shootout involving security forces. The campaign resulted in a demonstration against the Nigerian [[State Security Service (Nigeria)]], the secret police.This campaign was successful and the detainee was released.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hebblethwaite|first1=Cordelia|title=#BBCtrending: The man who 'disappeared' in Nigeria - #FreeCiaxon|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-26979508|accessdate=8 September 2014|work=BBC|publisher=BBC.com|date=11 April 2014}}</ref>
