==History==
In 1958, Thurman Averitt founded Livingston Merchant's Co-op, a small trucking company that hauled dry goods mostly between Nashville, TN and Livingston, TN. In 1969, Thurman incorporated his small company and called it Averitt Express. While making regular deliveries in Nashville, Thurman became acquainted with a young dockworker who helped him unload his trailer. This young man's name was Gary Sasser. Gary happened to ask Thurman one day if he would be interested in selling his company. After some thought, Thurman said yes. In October 1971, Gary Sasser, at the age of 20, purchased Averitt Express, which at the time consisted of two associates, three tractors and five trailers. Today, Averitt Express is one of the nation's leading freight transportation and supply chain management providers.

==Averitt Cares for Kids==
Averitt Cares for Kids is a non-profit charitable giving organization funded solely by our associates. The program roots date back to 1986 when Averitt’s associates decided they wanted to give something back to the company in a tangible way. They decided to purchase a new trailer and presented it to Averitt President and CEO Gary Sasser as their gift of thanks. The project generated so much pride and enthusiasm that associates decided to embark on a similar project the following year. This time, Gary recommended instead that associates use their contributions to give to the less fortunate. The result was the formation of Averitt Express Associate Charities, now known as Averitt Cares for Kids. 

For more than two decades, Averitt associates have touched the lives of the less fortunate through this program. The mission of Averitt Cares for Kids is to give back to our communities and help make a difference in the lives of others. In an effort to focus entirely on children, we updated the name of the program in 2007 from “Averitt Cares” to “Averitt Cares for Kids.” In doing so, we pledged that all future contributions will benefit causes that improve and save the lives of children. 

The organization is 100 percent funded entirely through voluntary associate contributions. Associates elect to have contributions deducted from their payroll on a weekly basis. More than 82 percent of our associates participate in the program. 

At the time the program was formed, it was one of the first associate-funded, charitable-giving organizations of its kind. Upon its introduction, it was profiled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. 

==Awards==
Averitt Express has won many quality awards for environmental responsibility, publication service, and safety, as well as many customer service awards from companies including Walmart, Dollar General, General Motors, Jack Daniels, etc. <ref>https://www.averittexpress.com/public/aboutUs/whyAveritt/awards.jsp</ref>
