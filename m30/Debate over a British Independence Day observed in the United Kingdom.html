The '''Debate over a British Independence Day observed in the United Kingdom''' concerns the cross-party calls by British politicians and general public appeals for the [[Brexit]] referendum result on the 23 June 2016 to be recognised as 'Independence Day' and be made a [[National Day|national holiday]] in the United Kingdom. On 29 June 2016 an [[online petition]] on the [[UK Parliament]] government website calling for 23 June to be "designated as Independence Day, and celebrated annually" reached over 20,000 signatories. As obliged, the government responded, stating there were "no current plans to create another public holiday."<ref>{{cite news |title=Petition No.: 123324 - The 23 June should be designated as Independence Day, and celebrated annually |publisher=[[UK Parliament]] |date=23 June 2016}}</ref> There were several rejected petitions, due to similarity, including one that proposed to "celebrate British independence from the EU with an annual national holiday."<ref>{{cite news |title=Petition No.: 133819 - Celebrate British independence from the EU with an annual national holiday |publisher=[[UK Parliament]] |date=24 June 2016}}</ref>
