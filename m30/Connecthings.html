===Beacons ===
Beacons are one of the more popular tools used when creating a smart and connected system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/beacons-and-ibeacons-create-a-new-market-2013-12|title=BEACONS: What They Are, How They Work, Apple's iBeacon Technology Is Ahead Of The Pack|website=Business Insider|last1=Danova|first1=Tony|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> Connecthings utilizes three types of beacon technology:

* [[Bluetooth low energy beacon|Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons]]: Beacon technology that utilizes a low energy standard communication protocol called Bluetooth 4.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connecthings.com/platform/#nfc|title=NFC|website=Connecthings}}</ref> It allows compatible smartphones, with Connecthings [[Mobiles for development|Mobile SDK]] applications, to detect the signal of nearby Bluetooth beacons - up to 30 meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/201636913-What-are-Broadcasting-Power-RSSI-and-other-characteristics-of-beacon-s-signal-|title=Beacons|website=Estimote|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> The signal emitted by the beacon “awakens” the application - even when closed.

===ADTAG===
ADTAG is the Connecthings SaaS platform used by cities and organizations to manage and contextualize in real-time the beacon network deployed in urban spaces. The platform allows users to program and define the mobile experience at a specific point and time, as well as provide analytics and customized metrics.<ref name="Our Platform">{{cite web|title=Our Platform|url=http://www.connecthings.com/platform/#nfc|website=Connecthings}}</ref>

Unique to the ADTAG platform is the ability to personalize the mobile experience at each connected point. To do so, ADTAG integrates various real-time data flows to contextualize notification content sent to mobile users while on the move in the city. ADTAG infrastructure allows for integration and management from the same interface of any type of Bluetooth beacons, from different manufacturers and customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://industrialiot5g.com/20160616/channels/news/exploring-role-contactless-beacons-smart-city-tag17|title=Exploring The Role Of Contactless Beacons In A Smart City|website=Industrial IoT 5G|last1=Loda|first1=Kyle|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> Additionally, the ADTAG platform enables multiple organizations and businesses to access the same beacon network within a city. This consolidation allows for organizations and brands to create [[Public-Private Partnerships|public-private partnerships (P3)]] with cities to solve complex problems such as promote safety and improve quality of life for residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iottechnews.com/news/2016/aug/08/how-brands-can-leverage-iot-and-connected-tech-become-public-servants/|title=How Brands Can Leverage The IoT And Connected Tech To Become Public Servants|website=IoT Tech News|last1=Gazel Anthoine|first1=Laetitia|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>
