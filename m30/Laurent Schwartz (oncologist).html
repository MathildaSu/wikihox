==Biorébus==
In 2004 he joined with others to start '''Biorébus''', which is both a think tank and a pharmaceutical company, with the  goal of   contributing to a change in paradigm in [[cancer]] research.<ref>{{cite news |first=Martine |last=Perez |date=November 8, 2007 |title=Le principe de vie, selon Laurent Schwartz |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/2007/11/07/01005-20071107ARTFIG90050-le_principe_de_vie_selon_laurent_schwartz.php |work=[[Le Figaro]] |language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Sophie |last=Coisne |title=Laurent Schwartz " Il faut simplifier notre vision du cancer " |url=http://www.larecherche.fr/content/recherche/article?id=24163 |work=[[La Recherche]] |language=French}}</ref> It was established as a cooperative as a parallel to the [[Bourbaki]] group’s initiative in mathematics in the late 1920s, which was a   collective pseudonym under which a group of (mainly French) 20th-century mathematicians wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics. The Biorébus group  (most of them from the [[École Polytechnique]], [[École Normale Supérieure]] intermingled with physicians, biologists and philosophers) meet every month. It feels that the crucial need is not to produce more data but to organize them in order to simplify biology as to make it understandable. Its work has been on trying to establish the hypotheses that [[cancer]] (whatever its subtype) is a metabolic disease akin to [[diabetes]], that inflammation (whatever its cause) is synonymous to increased osmolarity, and that the  toxicity of [[tobacco]] is a direct consequence of carbon dioxide poisoning

Its continuing goals are to determine whether  a combined metabolic therapy (Metabloc) can alleviate tumor growth in humans, to  understand the link between cancer in the elderly and [[Alzheimer's disease]], and to write in mathematical terms the similarities between [[biology]] and cellular electrical forces.
