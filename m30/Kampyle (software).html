==History==
Kampyle was founded in 2007 by Ariel Finkelstein, Eylon Steiner and Eran Savir.<ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=61432200 Kampyle Ltd. - Profile] BusinessWeek</ref> Amongst its initial investors was the Internet entrepreneur [[Yossi Vardi]]. 
Kampyle started selling its range of feedback solutions, with a [[freemium]] go-to-market model, in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vidra|first=Eze|title=Exclusive: Kampyle Raises Round from Carmel Ventures|url=http://www.vccafe.com/vc-cafe/exclusive-kampyle-raises-round-from-carmel-ventures/|newspaper=VCcafe|date=July 21, 2009}}</ref>

==Overview==

===Technology===
While [[web analytics]] cannot give insight into the motivation and actual user experience, Kampyle's feedback analytics enhances the capabilities of a company to understand their website users.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo!7 Selects Kampyleâ€™s Enterprise-Level Customer Feedback Solution|url=http://au.docs.yahoo.com/info/pr/pr.html?id=290|publisher=Yahoo!7 Australia|accessdate=Nov 3, 2011|date=Nov 3, 2011}}</ref>

===Products===

Feedback is seen as an empirical tool to gain insight into user behavior and motivation, and to optimize marketing and website strategies. Kampyle is said to have processed more than 12 million feedback forms in over 60 languages in 191 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kampyle and ClickTale Partner to Deliver Next-Gen Customer Feedback Analytics|url=http://business-newsarticles.com/business_articles/2011/07/kampyle-and-clicktale-partner-to-deliver-nextgen-customer-feedback-analytics-222942.htm|publisher=Business News Articles|accessdate=Nov 3, 2011|date=July 9, 2011}}</ref>
