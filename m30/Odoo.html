'''Odoo''' is a suite of [[open-source]] business apps written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and released under the [[Affero General Public License|AGPL license]]. It is used by 2 million users worldwide<ref>http://www.slideshare.net/openobject/keynote02</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=July 2014}} to manage companies of all different sizes. The main Odoo components are the server, 260 core modules (also called official modules) and around 4000 community modules.<ref>https://www.odoo.com/apps</ref>

Odoo was formerly known as OpenERP until May 2014. It was rebranded because version 8 of the software included apps including website builder, e-commerce, point of sale and business intelligence. The software conforms to standard expectations of ERP systems, while providing additional modules beyond the coverage of traditional ERP systems.

The official Odoo apps are organized in 6 groups:
* Front-end apps: website builder, blog, e-commerce
* Sales management apps: CRM, point of sales, quotation builder
* Business operations apps: project management, inventory, manufacturing, accounting and purchase
* Marketing apps: mass mailing, lead automation, events, survey, forum, live chat
* Human Resources apps: employee directory, enterprise social network, leaves management, timesheet, fleet management
* Productivity apps: business intelligence, instant messaging, notes

The software is actively programmed, supported, and organized by Odoo S.A. Odoo is similar to many [[open source]] projects where customized programming, support, and other services are also provided by an active global community and a network of 500 official partners.

==Business Applications==

Odoo s.a. provides a web site referencing the officially supported modules as well as community modules.<ref name="odooapps">[https://www.odoo.com/apps Odoo Apps]</ref> Community modules can be referenced for free as long as they respect the open source licence of Odoo. As of June 2014, the number of Odoo apps reached more than 4000.<ref name="odooapps" />

==Architecture==

Odoo uses a [[Service Oriented Architecture]] as a software architecture design pattern.

===Web Application Architecture===

The most recent versions of Odoo (including version 7) are mostly implemented as a [[web application]]. Odoo includes an [[application server]]/[[web server]] (known as the Odoo Server) that focuses on [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] [[business logic]], stores data through an interface with a [[database]], and web client for [[web browsers]] access. The server and business logic portion of Odoo is primarily written in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] [[programming language]]. The web client is primarily written in [[JavaScript]].

===Modules===

Business features are organized into modules. A module is a folder with a pre-defined structure containing Python code and [[XML]] files. A module defines data structure, forms, reports, menus, procedures, [[workflows]], etc... Modules can also contain web components written in [[JavaScript]].

===Database===

Odoo uses [[PostgreSQL]] as the [[database management system]].

===Source code and contributions===

Odoo [[source code]] is hosted on the [[GitHub]] project [[Shared web hosting service|hosting service]], using the [[Git (software)|Git]] [[distributed revision control]] system.<ref>[https://github.com/odoo/odoo Source]</ref>  The documentation is published on a separate website.<ref>[http://doc.odoo.com/ Documentation]</ref>

==Development environment==
Module development mainly relies around editing [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[XML]] files. Some application logic (i.e. workflows and data structure) can be changed through the client interface using a developer mode.
