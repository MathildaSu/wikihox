== History ==
The New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association was established in 1992 by a group of like minded veterinary nurses, seeking representation within the veterinary profession in New Zealand. Current membership of the association is around 850 members.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = NZVNA was set up in 1992 to promote the profession of veterinary nursing in New Zealand.|url = http://www.nzvna.org.nz/About+Us/Overview.html|website = www.nzvna.org.nz|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = FarmChat Article - NZ Veterinary Nursing Association celebrates 15 years|url = http://www.farmchat.co.nz/Article/ArticleDisplay.aspx?ArticleId=621|website = www.farmchat.co.nz|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> Veterinary nursing in New Zealand are seen as a profession in its own right, moving away from the previous classification of [[Paraveterinary workers in New Zealand|paraprofessionals.]]

== Purpose ==
The New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association functions as the representative body for veterinary nurses in New Zealand. It provides an annual Continuing Professional Development scheme, linked closely with the newly implemented voluntary registration. The association produces a quarterly journal and a regular e-newsletter keeping members up to date with current issues in the veterinary nursing profession.<ref name=":0" />

Executive committee members of the association provide support to its members on a wide range of topics, including HR, Health and Safety and Regulation. Since 2013, the organisation has run an annual Vet Nurse of the Year award, "acknowledging the work and effort nurses make in the veterinary industry".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vet Nurse of the Year 2013 {{!}} NZVA|url = http://www.nzva.org.nz/newsstory/vet-nurse-year-2013?destination=node%252F3461|website = www.nzva.org.nz|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Vet Nurse of the Year 2014 {{!}} NZVA|url = http://www.nzva.org.nz/newsstory/vet-nurse-year-2014?destination=node%252F4490|website = www.nzva.org.nz|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Going the distance for animals|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/manukau-courier/73403003/manukau-vet-nurse-first-in-her-field|website = Stuff|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> The organisation tries to raise awareness about common issue, for example obesity, which affect one in three pets.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Price |first1=Rosanna |title=A third of pets in New Zealand are overweight |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/cutestuff/72997202/A-third-of-pets-in-New-Zealand-are-overweight |accessdate=20 February 2016 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=15 October 2015}}</ref>

The NZVNA set recommended wage guidelines for veterinary nurses and veterinary nursing assistants.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Veterinary Nurse|url = https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/animal-care-and-conservation/animal-care/veterinary-nurse/|website = www.careers.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Salary Report 2015|url = http://www.nzvna.org.nz/About+Us/Salary+Report+2015.html|website = www.nzvna.org.nz|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref>

== Regulation ==
In 2016, the New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association implemented voluntary registration of veterinary nurses. Previously, there was no form of registration, or formal way of recognising veterinary nursing qualifications.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = International differences in the journey toward compulsory veterinary nurse registration|url = http://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/vetn.2014.5.9.538|journal = The Veterinary Nurse|date = 2014-11-02|issn = 2044-0065|pages = 538â€“542|volume = 5|issue = 9|doi = 10.12968/vetn.2014.5.9.538|first = Laura|last = Harvey|first2 = Rebecca|last2 = Ladyman|first3 = Mark|last3 = Farnworth}}</ref> Currently, registration is overseen by the New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association, with plans to establish a Veterinary Nursing Council of New Zealand to take over this process in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Regulation|url = http://www.nzvna.org.nz/regulation.html|website = www.nzvna.org.nz|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref>

The process of regulation of veterinary nurses coincides with the New Zealand government's review of veterinary nursing education. Veterinary nursing education underwent a mandated government review in 2014/2015, with new qualifications being delivered in 2016. These are the Certificate in Veterinary Technology - Veterinary Nursing Assistant, and Diploma in Veterinary Nursing.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Review of  Animal Care and Veterinary Nursing qualifications|url = http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/summaries/2015/jan15/revsumjan15-13.html|website = www.nzqa.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Qualification Overview|url = http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nzqf/search/viewQualification.do?selectedItemKey=2491|website = www.nzqa.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-18|first = corporateName=New Zealand Qualifications Authority|last = (NZQA)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Become a veterinary nurse {{!}} NZVA|url = http://www.nzva.org.nz/public/veterinary-careers/become-veterinary-nurse?destination=node%252F1105|website = www.nzva.org.nz|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> The Diploma in Veterinary Nursing is the minimum qualification required for registration.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/employment-skills/labour-market-reports/occupation-outlook/pdf-library/green-primary-industries-pdfs/Veterinary%20nurses.pdf|title = VETERINARY NURSES|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>
