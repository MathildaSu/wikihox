'''James Rodowsky''' (born January 1993) is an American [[short track speed skating]] competitor.

==Biography==
James Rodowsky was born in January 1993 in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. He first became interested in speed skating at age 8 after watching a Disney channel commercial featuring the sport. He asked his mother if he could try the sport, after researching on the internet she located a local speedskating club in [[Laurel, Maryland]].

On October 17, 2007 James achieved qualifying time of 1:33.1 at Robert Morris University Island Sport Center in Pittsburgh, PA which advanced him into the Americas Cup A Division of menâ€™s short track speed skating. This allowed James to compete in November 2007 in Saratoga Springs, NY beside Olympic and World Team skaters.

On February 27, 2008 James was one of only 25 men in the US to receive one of the William E. Simon Olympic Endowment awards.
