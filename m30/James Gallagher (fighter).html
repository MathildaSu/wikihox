'''James Gallagher''' (born 24 October 1996) is an Irish [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] from [[Strabane]], [[County Tyrone]]. He is currently signed with [[Bellator MMA]], where he fights in the [[Featherweight (MMA)|featherweight]] division.

==Background==
Gallagher was raised in Strabane, and lived there until he left school at the age of 15. He then moved in with his [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) head coach, John Kavanagh of [[Straight Blast Gym - Ireland|SBG Ireland]]. Gallagher had trained with Kavanagh since he was 13 years of age, but had grown tired of balancing school with the hours he spent getting to and from the gym every day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/05/bellator-signee-james-gallagher-has-been-turning-heads-including-john-kavanaghs-since-13 |work=MMA Junkie|date=May 2016 |title=Bellator teenager James Gallagher has been turning heads, including John Kavanagh's, since 13}}</ref>

==Brazilian jiu-jitsu==
When Gallagher began training at SBG, he was told by John Kavanagh that he would not be allowed to fight competitively again in MMA until he turned 17. Gallagher then began focusing primarily on [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] (BJJ), and had initially planned to win a gold medal in the [[World Jiu-Jitsu Championship|Mundials]]. At 15, he won gold in the blue belt adult divisions of the 2012 Irish Open.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-bright-lights-of-bellator-await-irish-wonderkid-james-gallagher |work=Fightland |date=April 2016 |title=THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF BELLATOR AWAIT IRISH WONDERKID JAMES GALLAGHER}}</ref> He then went on to win two No-Gi silver medals at the 2012 [[European Championship (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)|European Championship]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.ibjjfdb.com/Campeonato/000142/en-US/Results.pdf |work=IBJJF Database|date=August 2013 |title=European Open No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu Championship 2012}}</ref> and one gold medal in the [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|Gi]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.ibjjfdb.com/Campeonato/000154/en-US/Results.pdf |work=IBJJF Database|date=October 2013 |title=European Open Jiu-Jitsu Championship 2013}}</ref> Despite his dreams of a World Championship gold medal, and him earning his purple belt in 2013,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/strabanimalmma/status/360915889824075776 |work=Twitter |date=July 2013 |title=So proud to be awarded my purple belt...}}</ref> Gallagher neared his seventeenth birthday and his attention had began moving back towards MMA as a whole. He has not competed in BJJ since then, but it still remains his primary method of attack in MMA, where every one of his finishes have come by way of submission.

==Mixed martial arts career==
===Early career===
Though not included in most online records, Gallagher had his first amateur fight in 2010. The then 13 year old won by first-round submission against a "15, 16" year old, in a local show in his hometown Strabane. Gallagher's second fight also came when he was 13, this time against a 21 year old. Future coach John Kavanagh was supposed to judge the fight, but refused upon learning Gallagher's age. Gallagher recalls a displeased Kavanagh saying "I'm not judging this, this is going to ruin MMA as a sport in Ireland, it’s a kid fighting a grown man, not going to happen." But the fight went ahead, and despite an age difference which completely dwarfed that of him and his first opponent, Gallagher came out victorious once again. Despite Kavanagh's disapproval, he was instantly impressed, and invited Gallagher to train at his gym.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/strabanimalmma/status/360915889824075776 |work=MMA Latest|date=July 2016 |title=SBG prospect James Gallagher on Conor McGregor comparisons, upcoming Bellator debut and how he first met John Kavanagh}}</ref>

===Bellator MMA===
Gallagher signed with [[Bellator MMA]] in April 2016,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2016/4/7/11383464/sbg-prospect-james-gallagher-signs-with-bellator |work=MMA Fighting|date=April 2016 |title=SBG prospect James Gallagher signs with Bellator}}</ref> after amassing a 3-0 pro record. He made his promotional debut at [[Bellator 158]] the following July, defeating Mike Cutting via unanimous decision after a dominant performance in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://severemma.com/2016/07/james-gallagher-remains-undefeated-dominates-mike-cutting-bellator-158/ |work=Severe MMA|date=July 2016 |title=James Gallagher remains undefeated after dominating Mike Cutting at Bellator 158}}</ref> Gallagher's next fight is booked for Bellator 164, which takes place in [[Tel Aviv]] on November 10. He faces Kirill Medvedovski on the Israeli fighter's home soil.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/09/featherweight-prospects-james-gallagher-kirill-medvedovski-meet-at-bellator-164-in-israel |work=MMA Junkie|date=September 2016 |title=Featherweight prospects James Gallagher, Kirill Medvedovski meet at Bellator 164 in Israel}}</ref> In October 2016, Bellator president [[Scott Coker]] stated that "probably before the end of this year, we’ll have a fight in Ireland." Coker didnt confirm whether Gallagher would be on the card or not, but did express his thoughts on the teenager. "James is a young kid but we have a lot of faith in him that he will develop into a big star for Bellator all over the world," he said. "He’s a talented fighter but he also brings more than just fighting to the table. How he carries himself outside of the cage, he’s years ahead of his age in terms of how he handles himself. It’s really impressive for such a young guy. What he achieves will be up to him."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/bellator-planning-stage-first-show-ireland-end-2016-211655004--spt.html |work=Yahoo Sport|date=October 2016 |title=Bellator planning to stage its first show in Ireland before the end of 2016}}</ref>
