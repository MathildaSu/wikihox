'''Jammes Pires de Castro''' a.k.a '''JAMBA - '''"Jamba" as he is often refereed to in the entertainment industry is an entrepreneur, music producer, artist, songwriter, photographer, film director, designer and multi-instrumentalist<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Feature Entertainment|newspaper=The Nashville Rage=The Tenessean |date=2005-02-24 |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref>.

He describes Jamba Productions as "A high end full production creative enterprise with a conglomerate of media & communication entities whose purpose is to shape culture through the creation of original audio/visual content."<span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="99"></span>

== Origin ==
Jammes Pires de Castro, known as "jamba" was born in 1979 on the 23rd of October in the small rural town of [[Frutal]], in the state of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]].<ref name="last.fm">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jamba+Castro/+wiki|title=Jamba Castro|work=last.fm}}</ref> <span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="109"></span> His musical influences started very early on in his life as his father, Valter Ferreira de Castro was the bandleader and bassist of a band he had formed with his brothers named "Raio-x" (X-ray in English). As soon as Jamba was born his father would take the young baby to the rehearsals and the shows to watch the band play. <span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="113"></span>Since his father's band did many covers it was in this environment that Jamba would first be exposed to bands like [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Mr. Mister|Mister Mister]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire|Earth, Wind, And Fire]], [[Tears for Fears|Tears For Fears]], [[U2]], and [[Michael Jackson]].

Jamba and his mother moved to [[Westchester County]] in 1988 from Brazil to escape the bitter and harsh realities of Brazil in the late 80's.

== Piano & Bass ==
Jamba started his formal musical education at the age of 11 with piano teacher, educator and [[New School]] graduate [[Sergio Chiacchi]]o in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], NY. It was Sergio who would introduce his young protegé to both classical and jazz.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT-vH0pAv9E|title="I Like You Like That" Melissa Polinar & Jamba duet|date=1 August 2008|work=YouTube}}</ref> After quickly developing his chops by playing Scarlatti, [[Bach]] and [[Chopin]] it was [[jazz]] that would fascinate the boy's young heart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/jamba|title=Jamba @ All About Jazz|work=All About Jazz}}</ref> Influenced by [[Keith Jarrett]] and [[Bill Evans]], Jamba only in his early teens quickly became a sought out musician for diverse applications. The piano would not be the only instrument of choice for the multi-instrumentalist like his father shared a deep love for the electric bass. Inspired by the [[Jaco Pastorius]] videos he would see at Sam Ash (where he would practice because he had no piano) he took the frets off of an old 4-string Fender someone had given him and would fill in the holes with wood putty - consecrating it his first "fret-less bass"<span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="125"></span>

== Early marriage ==
At 19 years of age Jamba married his first girlfriend and first kiss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicalidadenow.tumblr.com/post/2072548731/jammes-castro-jamba-em-meio-a-uma-entrevista|title=Musicalidade Now|work=tumblr.com}}</ref> They had 3 daughters together.

== Birth and Early Days of Jamba Productions ==
At 8 years old Jamba and his mother moved to the US in search of freedom from sexism and cultural ignorance. Jamba would start music production at the tender age of 11 and at 12 he was already a musical director at the church where he and his mom would attend in the Bronx. It would not be until he was 16 that he would produce his first full album. Living in New York, Southeast Florida and Nashville Jamba would acquire much experience both as a producer, touring musician and record producer. During this period from his late teens to his late 20's his musicality gained more momentum as he started to work with renowned musicians, artists, and producers like: [[Michael W. Smith]], [[Jaci Velasquez]],<ref>CA STAFF. [http://www.christianactivities.com/jaci-vel%C3%A1squez-unspoken "Jaci Velásquez - Unspoken"], ''[[Christian Activities]]'', Nashville, 1 January 2003.</ref> [[Take 6]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Natalie Grant]], [[The Katinas]],[[Vivian Green]], [[Scott Jacoby (producer)|Scott Jacoby]], Jason Perry (plus one), 4 HIM, [[Tommy Sims]], [[Israel Houghton]], [[Anointed]], [[Out of Eden]] , [[Michael Omartian]]

== Mentorship & Tutelage with Michael Omartian & Terry Christian ==
The expressive and multiple [[Grammy]] award-winning producer [[Michael Omartian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22christopher+cross%22|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs}}</ref> and the revered [[grammy]] nominee audio & mix engineer [[Terry Christian]]<ref>Variety Staff. [http://variety.com/2006/music/news/49th-annual-grammy-nominations-list-part-2-1117955272/ "49th annual Grammy nominations list — part 2"] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', December 7, 2006. Retrieved on 13 October 2015.</ref> exercised enormous influence on Jamba.  Michael saw something tangibly uncommon in the young artist/producer and invited what he would endearingly call his "young padwan" to frequent his house.It was there during those 3 years of tutelage that a very deep and lifelong relationship between Michael and Jamba would evolve forever shaping the boy's talent and character.<ref name="last.fm"/> "Pops (what jamba calls Michael) taught me everything i know. he instilled in me the nobility of character that will forever embody the incalculable and priceless legacy he has built over all these years. He is, for all intents and purposes one of the closest things i have ever had to a father."

He was mentored by legendary producer Michael Omartian ([[Christopher Cross]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Al Jarreau]]). "Michael and I became really good friends, and he taught me so much about production. I mean, he's had some of the biggest hits in the history of pop music, so obviously I was a sponge and just was honored that he would take me under his wing." Omartian, a skilled pianist himself, was quick to hone in on Jambas ability, not just as a keyboard player, but as a composer and vocalist of distinct nuance. He encouraged Jamba to purse a solo artist career and even went as far as recording and producing the demos of his young protégée. With Omartian singing his praises Jamba went on to secure work with many of the producers industry friends, landing the steady gig as disco icon, [[Donna Summers]] main pianist/keyboard player while recording with many of Nashville's best known producers. Fellow Nashville resident, Take 6's Mark Kibble, with whom Jamba has worked, described him as the new [[Greg Phillinganes]] (mainstay keyboardist for [[Quincy Jones]], Michael Jackson and [[Eric Clapton]] to name just a few). "That was an incredible thing for him to say - Ive admired Gregs work for so long; not just his technical ability but his ability to feel the pocket makes his work so special.<ref>http://groovesharks.org/artist/Jamba-Castro</ref>

==Artistry and New York City==
In January 2005 Jamba releases a pop/jazz EP entitled "The Blue Note Sessions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plan9music.com/Item/9004610500|title=Plan9 Music - The Blue Note Sessions|work=plan9music.com}}</ref> in this album he plays the piano and sings 6 original songs. Besides Jamba the compositions included contributions from renowned songwriters like [[Alex Petrounov]], [[Eric Bledsoe]], and [[Steven Sater]].

== Expansion to Japan ==
Jamba's productions and talent would start garner global attention during his time in [[Nashville]]. His love for [[Japanese culture]], [[art]] and [[life philosophy]] would ignite a desire to expand [[Jamba Productions]] to Japan. In 2010 Jamba would go to Japan to produce the artist [[Maru Fire Lily]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://j-lyric.net/artist/a054abd/|title=Fire Lilyの歌詞リスト|work=j-lyric.net}}</ref> proliferating his talent to the east of the globe. Interesting to note that besides his unbridled creativity Jamba is also a [[polyglot]] speaking 6 languages: [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]  (whom he taught himself to read [[hiragana]], [[katana]], and basic [[kanji]])."Growing up in [[New York City]] you were just so exposed to so many different languages. They felt like music to me and so it was always easy to pick up." His fascination for other cultures and languages would later shape his desire to have a global enterprise

== Expansion To Brazil ==
In 2008 the Brazilian [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] singer and composer [[Luiz Arcanjo]] on a tour in [[Florida]] would hear one of Jamba's productions. It was in 2009 that Luiz would hire Jamba to produce his album. The album was quickly praised by Brazilian media and garnered attention and respect from the people who dictated trends in the Brazilian music industry. Falling in love with Brazil and rediscovering his roots Jamba decided to expand [[Jamba Productions]] to [[Brazil]]. Besides Luiz, Jamba would produce other renowned Brazilian artists such as [[Marcus Salles]]:[[Meu Lugar]], for [[Sony]], [[Daniela Araújo]]:[[Guia-me]], [[Ton Carfi]]:<ref>Dhaii M (Adailton Moura). [http://www.supergospel.com.br/analise_cd-ton-carfi-revolucao_3338.html "CD Revolução"] ''[[Supergospel]]'' January 11, 2012. Retrieved on 13 October 2015.</ref>[[Revolution|Revolução]] e atualmente em 2015, o cantor [[Solomon|Salomão]]:[[Igual a Você]].

After getting his feet wet in Brazil he decided to focus on the consolidation of his company, a process which he would later describe as "terrifyingly brutal, and absolutely enriching - the best of times and the worst of times." He goes on to explain, "Brazil is like the wild west. Every entrepreneur should spend some years here, because it forces you to think absolutely beyond the curve. It's like building a 5 star hotel with a flint in the middle of the [[Sahara]]. There is just so much red tape and every process is dripping with bureaucracy, things take forever and the cultural fabric is practically built on distrust. But with all that being said there is just so much talent and the people are oppressed by institutions, so it inspires people like me who like to build."

It was not until June 17, 2012 that Jamba would make his expansion in Brazil oficial. "Brazil lack nothing in the talent sector. They can hang with the best of them."<span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="200"></span> According to Jamba his expansion to Brazil has different layers of importance. "the entertainment industry in Brazil is governed by a modus operandi of exploitation. [[Jamba Productions]] has a far bigger social and [[political significance]] here that empirically overshadows the lucrative agenda. We have become a force driving quantifiable change in the culture and that has a much more rewarding result than the outdated [[profit-driven]] model."<span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="205"></span>
