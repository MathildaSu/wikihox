The '''Hadith al-Thaqalayn''' refers to a saying ([[hadith]]) about ''al-Thaqalayn'', which translates to "the two weighty things." In this hadith Muhammad referred to the [[Qur'an]] and ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'' ('people of the house', Muhammed's family) as the two weighty things. Although the Hadith is accepted by both Sunnis and Shi'as, the two groups differ on the exact wording of what Muhammad said, as well how to interpret these words. The [[Shia]]s use the ''Hadith al-Thaqalayn'' to prove their claim that Muhammad meant for all his [[Succession to Muhammad|successors]] to be from his own family (''Ahl al-Bayt''). [[Wahabi]]s reject this view and believe in a different interpretation of Hadith al-Thaqalayn. However [[Sunni]]s believe that the Hadith does refer to the Family of the Prophet and his successors.

== Interpretation ==

Both Sunnis and Shi'as believe that Muhammad said the following:

{{QuoteHadith|Yazid b. Hayyan|matn=I went along with Husain b. Sabra and 'Umar b. Muslim to Zaid b. Arqam and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to him: Zaid. you have been able to acquire a great virtue that you saw Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) listened to his talk, fought by his side in (different) battles, offered prayer behind me. Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: I have grown old and have almost spent my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), so accept whatever I narrate to you, and which I do not narrate do not compel me to do that. He then said: One day Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up to deliver sermon at a watering place known as Khumm situated between Mecca and Medina. He praised Allah, extolled Him and delivered the sermon and. exhorted (us) and said: Now to our purpose. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but '''I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family.''' He (Husain) said to Zaid: '''Who are the members of his household?''' Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they? '''Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of 'Ali''', 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of 'Abbas. Husain said: These are those for whom the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. Zaid said: Yes."|Sunni= as [[Sahih]]|SunniS=[[Sahih Muslim]]<ref>{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|031|5920}}</ref>}}

{{QuoteHadith|Yazid b. Hayyan|matn=We went to him (Zaid b. Arqam) and said to him. You have found goodness (for you had the honour) to live in the company of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and offered prayer behind him, and the rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation of wording that lie said: Behold, for I am leaving amongst you two weighty things, one of which is the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, and that is the rope of Allah. He who holds it fast would be on right guidance and he who abandons it would be in error, and in this (hadith) these words are also found: '''We said: Who are amongst the members of the household? Aren't the wives (of the Holy Prophet) included amongst the members of his house hold? Thereupon he said: No, by Allah, a woman lives with a man (as his wife) for a certain period; he then divorces her and she goes back to her parents and to her people; the members of his household include his ownself and his kith and kin (who are related to him by blood) and for him the acceptance of Zakat is prohibited.'''"|Sunni= as [[Sahih]]|SunniS=[[Sahih Muslim]]<ref>{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|031|5923}}</ref>}}

{{QuoteHadith|matn=I m leaving among you something which is very important and should be followed, you will not go astray if you get hold of it after I am gone, one part of it being more important than the other: Allah's Book, which is a rope stretched from Heaven to Earth, and my close relatives, who belong to my household. These two will not separate from one another till they come down to the reservoir, so consider how you act regarding them after my departure."|Tirmidhi}}

While both Sunnis and Shi'as believe in respecting [[Ahl al-Bayt]], the Shi'a believe that the successors of the Prophet were appointed from the [[Ahl al-Bayt]], while Sunnis reject the claim that anyone was appointed as successor.

But according to the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]<ref name="bewley.virtualave.net">[http://bewley.virtualave.net/muwcont.html]</ref> by [[Malik ibn Anas]]:
{{cquote|" 46.3 Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I have left two things with you. As long as you hold fast to them, you will not go astray. They are the Book of Allah and the Sunna of His Prophet.".}} <ref>[http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw18.html#decree]</ref>

There are also other versions of this Hadith that say:{{Primary source-inline|date=July 2013}}
{{cquote|"I leave for you the Quran alone you shall uphold it. Muslim 15/19, nu 1218; ibn Majah 25/84, Abu dawud 11/56.}}

For this reason Muslims regard the Quran as the most authentic book in Islam. Many of these books were written between 100 and 300 years after Muhammad. There had been oral transmission from generation to generation until then.{{OR|date=July 2013}}

== Shia view ==

Shi'as believe that Muhammad said ''Hadith al-Thaqalayn'' multiple times in multiple settings in multiple wordings. They argue that Muhammad said ''Hadith al-Thaqalayn'' at Mount Arafat during his Farewell Sermon, at Ghadir Khumm, in the mosque of Medinah, during his last illness, and at many other places and times. 

Shi'as believe that this hadith is [[mutawattir]], meaning that it has been related so many times by so many people that there is no doubt about its authenticity. Shi'as claim that this hadith is the most authentic of hadiths, claiming that it has been narrated by over 35 companions of Muhammad.

The ''Hadith al-Thaqalayn'' is used by the Shi'a, among other reasons, to justify their claim of [[Ali]]'s [[succession to Muhammad]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Shi'as view this hadith as a clear indication that Muhammad wished to keep the matter of leadership within his own family, starting with his cousin Ali. They say that Muhammad was clearly indicating that only the ''Ahl al-Bayt'' have a right to authority and leadership. It is based on this claim that the Shi'as reject the first three Sunni Caliphs, referring to them as usurpers and tyrants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Because the Shi'a believe that Muhammad said ''Hadith al-Thaqalayn'' on many occasions, the Shi'a have many different versions of what Muhammad said. One such version corresponds closely to what the Sunnis also believe in:
<blockquote>
Muhammad said: "One of them (i.e. the Thaqalayn) is the Book of Allah and the other one is my select progeny (Itrat), that is family (Ahlul-Bayt). Beware of how you behave (with) them when I am gone from amongst you, for Allah, the Merciful, has informed me that these two (i.e., Quran and Ahlul-Bayt) shall never separate from each other until they reach me in Heaven at the Pool (of al-Kawthar). I remind you, in the name of Allah, about my Ahlul-Bayt. I remind you, in the name of Allah, about my Ahlul-Bayt. Once more! I remind you, in the name of Allah, about my Ahlul-Bayt." <ref>A’alam al-Wara, pp 132-133</ref>
</blockquote>
Volume 6, Chapter 31, Hadith No. 3788:
<blockquote>
Zaid bin Arqam, narrated that the messenger of Allah . said: "'''Indeed, I am leaving among you, that which if you hold fast to them, you shall not be misguided after me. One of then is greater than the other: (First is) The book of Allah is a rope extended from the sky to the earth, and (the second is) my family, the people of my house (ahlul bait), and they shall not split until they meet me at the hawd, so look at how you deal with them after me.'''" (Sahih).
</blockquote>

Volume 6, Chapter 31, Hadith No. 3786:
<blockquote>
Jibir bin Abdullah said: "I saw the Messenger of Allah during his Hajj, on the '''Day of Arafah (on his last pilgrimage)'''. He was upon his camel Al-Qaswa, giving a Khutbah, so he said: '''O People! Indeed, I have left among you, that which if you hold fast to it, you shall not go astray: The Book of Allah (Quran) and my Family, the People of my House (Ahlul-Bait)'''.(Sahih)
</blockquote>

The Shi'as, however, also believe in other versions of the Hadith such as:
<blockquote>
"I have left with you something, which if you strictly adhere to, you shall never go astray–The Book of Allah and my progeny."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I leave you two weighty things, if you stick to both you will never go astray after me: the Book of Allah and my progeny."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I am leaving for you two precious and weighty Symbols that if you adhere to both of them, you shall not go astray after me. They are, the Book of Allah, and my progeny, that is, my Ahl al-Bayt. The Merciful has informed me that these two shall not separate from each other till they come to me by the Pool (of Paradise)."
</blockquote>
