'''Eric Forgue''' (born May 12th, 1994) is an american activist with a focus on animal cruelty. His major goal is to prevent cruelty to animals and protect wildlife by creating the [[Humane Law Enforcement Movement]] with the idea of making sure that there are established [[Humane law enforcement]] agencies at federal, state, and local levels to ensure the protection of the rights and well-being of animals, along with the focus on environmental security.

== Activism ==
=== Animal Rights ===
Eric Forgue founded the [[Humane Law Enforcement Movement]], a movement to persuade the government to start establishing humane law enforcement agencies around the country. <br />
<br />
In December of 2013, Eric became a licensed humane investigator in the state of Illinois. With this license, he was allowed to investigate complaints of animal cruelty and remove animals kept in inhumane conditions. Eric's license expired in January 2016 and has not been renewed since. He now spends his time volunteering at his local humane society, which he has been at since August of 2013. His experience as a humane investigator is what enticed him to create the movement. During his time on the field, Eric felt like there were not enough rights given to humane investigators and felt like there was little police support in his investigations. He then decided that is would be best to try to start a separate police force that is dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty. 
=== LGBTQ ===
As an openly gay male, Eric has been a supporter for LGBT rights. While attending community college at [[Joliet Junior College]], Eric was part of the GSA (Gay, Straight, Alliance) there. During his time in the club, he worked on eliminating hate for the LGBTQ community by helping out with the [[Safe zone]] program there and being part of the "Student Speaker's Bureau", a program where students share their experience being an ally or member of the LGBTQ community and helping inform people on proper terminology and LGBTQ issues.
=== Environmental ===
Eric Forgue has been an advocate for ensuring the protection of wildlife and nature by voicing for greener energy sources and against the destruction of wildlife. He has openly voiced against the [[Keystone Pipeline]] and the [[BP oil spill]]. Eric has also signed many petitions preventing damage or the removal of any habitats for animals.
