'''Bodhisattvas of the Earth''' [地涌の菩薩] (Jpn jiyu-no-bosatsu) are the infinite number of [[bodhisattva]]s who, in the 15th ("Emerging from the Earth") chapter of the [[Lotus Sutra]], emerged from a cleft in the ground during the grand "Ceremony in the Air" which had commenced in the 11th ("Emergence of the Treasure Tower") chapter.  Later, in the 21st ("Supernatural Powers") chapter, Shakyamuni passes on to them the responsibility for to the suffering people in the feared future era of the Latter Day of the Law (see [[Three Ages of Buddhism]]).<ref name="Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism">{{cite web|last1=Soka Gakkai International|authorlink1=Bodhisattvas of the Earth|title=Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism|url=http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=175|website=SGI Library}}</ref>

==Description==
In the 15th ("Emerging from the Earth") chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the vast number of bodhisattvas who had appeared to hear Shakyamuni preach in the "Ceremony in the Air" hoped to receive the Buddha's permission to be the ones to propagate the Dharma to suffering people in the perilous era to come.  To their great chagrin, Shakyamuni refused their request, deferring this honor to unnamed bodhisattvas who already existed in the empty space underneath the ''saha'' world [tr: "the world of pain and endurance where humans live"]. Right after he made this statement the earth shook and a mighty fissure appeared.  Dramatically and in a single instant, bodhisattvas whose numbers are described in the sutra as "immeasurable, boundless, beyond anything that can be known through calculation, simile or parable".<ref name=Watson>{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=translated by Burton|title=The Lotus sutra : and its opening and closing sutras|date=2009|publisher=Soka Gakkai|location=Tokyo|isbn=978-4-412-01409-1|page=253}}</ref>  Each one "has a retinue equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers," all of them "golden in hue, with the thirty-two features [of the Buddha] and an immeasurable brightness."<ref>Watson (2009), p. 252</ref>  These bodhisattvas had four leaders and guiding teachers: Superior Practices (the leader of the four), Boundless Practices, Pure Practices, and Firmly Established Practices.<ref name="Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism"/>

==Interpretation in Nichiren Buddhism==
[[Nichiren]] Buddhists regard the 15th ("Emerging from the Earth") chapter as the opening of what they regard as the Lotus Sutra's essential teachings (chapters 14-28). The emergence of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth thus holds great significance.  Nichiren (1222–1282) self-identified himself as Bodhisattva Superior Practices in several of his writings such as "The Opening of the Eyes." He claimed to qualify for this designation as the one who first grasped and taught the Mystic Law of [[Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]] in the Latter Day.

In his letter "The True Aspect of All Phenomena," Nichiren clearly stated that followers of his who spread and promote his teachings are fellow Bodhisattvas of the Earth: "There should be no discrimination among those who propagate the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo in the Latter Day of the Law, be they men or women. Were they not Bodhisattvas of the Earth, they could not chant the daimoku. At first only Nichiren chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two, three, and a hundred followed, chanting and teaching others. Propagation will unfold this way in the future as well. Does this not signify 'emerging from the earth'?"<ref>Nichiren Daishonin, Soka Gakkai International (ed) (1999). The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, Vol-1, p. 385.</ref>

==Interpretation in Soka Gakkai Buddhism==
While imprisoned during World War II under the charge of [[lese-majeste]], [[Josei Toda]], who was to become the second president of the [[Soka Gakkai]], experienced an awakening in which he understood himself as one of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth.  [[Daisaku Ikeda]], the third president of the Soka Gakkai, often describes Soka Gakkai members as the present-day Bodhisattvas of the Earth.<ref>Daisaku Ikeda, The Heart of the Lotus Sutra. (2014). 
Middleway Press. p. 169: “President Toda said, ‘In terms of the surface meaning of the sutras, or in terms of our external function, we are Bodhisattvas of the Earth. But from the standpoint of faith, we are followers and later disciples of Nichiren Daishonin. This conviction, he went on to say, is the ‘central idea of the Soka Gakkai.’”; p. 337: "The SGI is a gathering of Bodhisattvas of the Earth who, just as in the ceremony on Eagle Peak, have appeared to lead all people of the Latter Day to enlightenment and so fulfill their eternal vow.  We are eternal comnrades advancing together over the three existences toward kosen-rufu."</ref>
