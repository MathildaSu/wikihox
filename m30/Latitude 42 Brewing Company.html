'''Latitude 42 Brewing Company''' is an American brewing company located in [http://www.portagemi.gov/ Portage, MI] and was the first [[microbrewery]] to open in Portage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondwavemedia.com/southwest-michigan/features/latitude42brewingcompany0808.aspx/|title=Latitude 42 hops forward with Portage's first microbrewery|publisher=}}</ref>  Latitude 42 Brewing Company opened its doors in 2013 and has produced 57 different varieties of beer since opening.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32587/?view=beers&show=all|title=Latitude 42 Brewing Company - Portage, MI - Beers|publisher=}}</ref>  In addition to the microbrewery, Latitude 42 has a restaurant and bar located at their Portage facility.

==History==
In August 2012, master brewer Scott Freitas resigned as the Head Brewer at the Maui Brewing Co in Hawaii to open a brewing company in Portage, MI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2013/06/latitude_42_brewing_co_head_br.html|title=Latitude 42 Brewing Co. head brewer leaves Hawaii to help open Portage's first microbrewery|publisher=}}</ref>  With more than 20 years of brewing experience, Scott and co-founders Todd Neumann and Joe Stoddard designed and built the 11000 square foot Brewery and Restaurant.  The Brewery was called Latitude 42 due to the geographical location of the brewery on the latitude line of 42 degrees and Scott hopes to open more breweries along this specific latitude line.  The brewery opened in July 2013 with a menu of 14 beers and now has brewed, distributed and served more than 57 varieties of beer to date.  Latitude 42 only cans their beer for distribution to preserve freshness, rather than using glass bottles.

==Awards==
In 2016, Latitude 42 Brewing Company won a Can Can award, which is an international beer competition focused on canned beers from the US and Canada.  Latitude 42 won first place in the American Style Indian Pale Ale category with their I.P.EH! beer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cancanawards.com/2016-medalists/|title=2016 Winners of the Can Can Awards|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2015, Latitude 42 won the Michigan Brewery of the Year award at the New York International Beer Competition

Latitude 41 has also won numerous gold and silver medals for different beers at the World Beer Expo, Australian International Beer Awards, New York International Beer Competition, North American Brewers Association Awards and multiple others<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latitude42brewingco.com/awards/|title=Latitude 42 Brewing Company -   Awards|publisher=}}</ref>
