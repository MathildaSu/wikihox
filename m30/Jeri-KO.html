'''Jeri-KO''' is a [[professional wrestling]] tag team competing in [[WWE]] composed of [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Kevin Owens]], under the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]]. The team's name (much like Jericho's former tag team's) is a combination of the first part of Jericho's surname and Owens' initials.<ref>{{cite web|title=THIS SUNDAY: The team of #JeriKO (@FightOwensFight & @IAmJericho) takes on @WWEAaLLday21 & @BigCassWWE! #SummerSlam|url=https://twitter.com/WWE/status/765358431460962305|work=WWE|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
===Feuds (2016-present)===
Chris and Kevin first teamed together on Smackdown on April 7th where [[Sami Zayn]] interfered to help [[Antonio Cesaro]] and [[A.J. Styles]] defeat them unfairly.<ref name=April7/> Three weeks later they got revenge against Zayn by defeating him and [[Dean Ambrose]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/04-21-2016 |title=WWE SmackDown results, April 21, 2016: Jericho & Owens snatched a victory away from Ambrose & Zayn in the U.K. |website=wwe.com}}</ref> The Zayn feud culminated July 18 on Raw with Zayn and Cesaro defeating Jericho and Owens.

On the August 1 episode of ''Raw'', after a mixed tag team match between the teams of [[Charlotte (wrestler)|Charlotte]] and [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Enzo Amore]] and [[Sasha Banks]] was won by the former, Jericho attacked Enzo until [[Colin Cassady|Big Cass]] came out to help his partner. Later in the event, Owens told Jericho that he had his back during a backstage interview with [[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]].<ref name="Raw08012016">{{cite web|last1=Caldwell|first1=James|title=8/1 WWE Raw Results – CALDWELL’S Complete Live TV Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/08/01/aug1rawresultsfinal/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref> As part of the gimmick, Jericho often calls Tom Phillips the wrong name. The following week, Jericho defeated Amore by disqualification when Cass interfered. After the match, Cass challenged Owens and Jericho to a tag team match at [[SummerSlam (2016)|SummerSlam]], which Owens and Jericho, now calling themselves Jeri-KO, accepted.<ref name="Raw08082016">{{cite web|last1=Caldwell|first1=James|title=8/8 WWE Raw Results – CALDWELL’S Complete Live TV Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/08/08/aug8rawtvresultsfinal/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}</ref> At Summerslam, Jeri-KO defeated [[Enzo and Cass|Enzo Amore and Big Cass]].<ref name="SSlam2016">{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=8/21 WWE Summerslam Results – CALDWELL’S Complete Live Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/08/21/summerslam2016resultsfinal/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}</ref>
