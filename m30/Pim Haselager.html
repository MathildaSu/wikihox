'''Willem F.G. "Pim" Haselager''' (born 14 August 1960, [[Haarlem]]) is a Dutch philosopher-researcher in the [[philosophy]] of [[cognitive science]]. In the [[Netherlands]] he is part of a growing minority of [[scientists]] and [[philosophers]] advocating an [[Embodied Embedded Cognition|embodied embedded]] perspective on [[cognition]] and [[intelligent behavior]]. Pim lives in [[Groesbeek]] and [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]. He holds a position at the [[Radboud University]] in [[Nijmegen]].

== Life and work ==
Haselager obtained a [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]. He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in 1995 at the [[Free University of Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]. He is particularly interested in the integration of empirical work (i.e. psychological experiments, [[brain imaging]], computational modeling, and [[robotics]]) with philosophical issues regarding [[knowledge]] and intelligent behavior.

He analyzed the debate between proponents of classical [[cognitive science]] and [[connectionism]] on the nature of [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], in relation to the inability of [[computational model]]s to deal with the [[frame problem]], which is related to common sense behavior, [[knowledge]] and [[reasoning]]. He examined the consequences of this debate for the status of [[folk psychology]].

More recently he extended his research by investigating the embodied embeddedness of [[cognition]] ([[Embodied Embedded Cognition|EEC]]) in relation to [[dynamical systems theory]] (DST). According to Haselager, both EEC and DST sharpen the debate on the role of representations in cognitive science. Currently he investigates the question of how far one can push non-representational ways of [[scientific modelling|modeling]] intelligent behavior, experimentally and through [[robot]] [[simulations]]
