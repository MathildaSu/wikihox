The '''Howie scream''' (also known as the '''Howie Long scream''' or '''Screams 3; Man, Gut-wrenching Scream And Fall Into Distance''') is a frequently-used film and television [[stock sound effect]] for a [[Vociferation|scream]]. Believed to have originated in 1980 as a sound effect in the movie ''[[The Ninth Configuration]]'', the sound effect is featured as '''Screams 3; Man, Gut-wrenching Scream And Fall Into Distance''' in a [[CSS Studios|Hollywood Edge]] sound library called ''The Premiere Edition''. Often compared to the  [[Wilhelm scream]], its prominence in a number of movies has given it a few nicknames such as '''Howie Long Scream''', in reference to [[Howie Long]]'s death scene in the movie ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]''.<ref name="Howie Long">{{Cite web | title = Top 10 Movie Sound Effects We All Recognize | url = http://listverse.com/2009/09/25/top-10-movie-sound-effects-we-all-recognize/ | accessdate = 23 January 2011}}</ref>
