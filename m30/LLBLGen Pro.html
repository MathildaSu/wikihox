'''LLBLGen Pro''' is an [[O/R mapper]] and [[code generator]] for the [[Microsoft .NET]] platform, created by [http://www.sd.nl/ Solutions Design bv]. Computer programmers and software architects use this software to create a data-access tier and business objects tier in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[VB.NET]] for several O/R mapping frameworks, like [[NHibernate]], [[Entity Framework]], [[Language Integrated Query#LINQ to SQL (formerly called DLINQ)|LINQ to SQL]], and its own framework. Because LLBLGen Pro supports a lot of different databases to work with, software developers can choose the best framework and database per project.

== History ==
In 2003, the popular open source tool [[LLBLGen]] was succeeded by this commercial Pro version. Solutions Design bv continued to work on improvements and feature additions, like [[LINQ]] support and the ability to work both database-first and model-first.

== Databases supported ==
* MS Access 2000/XP/2003/2007/2010/2013
* SQL Server 2000/2005/2008/2008R2/2012/Express/SQL Server CE Desktop
* Oracle 9i/10g/11g/12c
* PostgreSQL 7.4+/8.x/9.x
* Firebird 1.5.x/2.x
* IBM DB2 7.x/8.x/9.x/10.x (not on AS/400)
* MySQL 4.x,5.x (using Core Lab's/DevArt MySQL .NET provider)
* Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE)
* Sybase iAnywhere (ASA)

== O/R mapper frameworks supported ==
LLBLGen Pro supports the following O/R mapper frameworks<ref name="InfoQ">[http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/06/LLBLGen-Pro-3.0 InfoQ: LLBLGen Pro 3.0 Now Supports Multiple Persistence Frameworks]</ref>
* LLBLGen Pro Runtime Framework 4.1
* [[Entity Framework]] v1, v4, v5 and v6
* LINQ to SQL
* [[NHibernate]] 3.x (hbm.xml and FluentNHibernate)

The system is extensible so any third-party O/R mapper framework can be used in the designer, to consume the abstract entity model plus the mappings to relational model data to generate C# / VB.NET classes and mapping files in the format of the targeted O/R mapper framework.

== Feature summary ==
LLBLGen Pro consists of two parts: a visual designer and the O/R mapper framework. 

Key features of the visual designer:
* [[Visual Studio]] integrated designer
* Model first (entity model is leading) and database first (relational model/schema is leading) mapping / modelling
* Grouping of project elements
* Value types ([[Domain-driven design]])
* Model views, to create visual views over (sub)graphs in the entity model
* Text-DSL based quick model editor for quickly define an entity model by typing facts
* Update/Create DDL SQL script generation
* Built-in template editor
* Table Valued Functions
* Template based, task oriented code generation system
* LINQ based project search
* Map single entity model onto schemas from multiple database types (for example, Oracle and SQL Server) in a single project
* Support for multiple O/R mapper frameworks.
* Support for entity inheritance/entity splitting
* Import system to build a model quickly by importing parts from external sources.

Key features of the O/R mapper framework:
* True database independent code
* Full Async API
* Full entity type inheritance
* Custom developer code is preserved
* LINQ support
* Flexible concurrency mechanism
* Derived table support
* Table Valued Functions support
* Query result cache support
* Auditing support
* Authorization support
* [[Dependency injection]] mechanism
* Fast and compact serialization
* Optimal and fast pre-fetch paths (eager loading)
* Hierarchical in-memory projections
* Native Enum support
* Transient error recovery.
* Map Typed View on stored procedure resultset
* WCF [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA) Services support
* WCF Data Services support (OData)
