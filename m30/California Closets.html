==History==
In 1978, California Closets was founded by 18-year-old college student [[Neil Balter]], who turned his idea of maximizing space in his dorm room closet into a small business. The company expanded in the [[San Fernando Valley]] in 1982, and opened its first international franchise in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|BC]], in 1985.

In 1986, the company introduced its core “Classic” line of storage solutions including a European railing system, miter-cut drawers, and melamine. California Closets was purchased by [[Williams-Sonoma]] in 1990 and in 1993 became the first customized storage solution company to expand product offerings beyond the bedroom closet to include garage, home office, and kitchen pantry. In 1994, [[Williams-Sonoma]] sold California Closets, and the company was independent until acquired by The Franchise Company in 1998.

In 1999, California Closets introduced the “Paradiso” line, a modern, European-styled line of storage, and in 2000 rolled out the “Suite” line of custom storage, floor-based, more furniture-like options.<ref name="California Closets website"/>

Additional lines include the “Virtuoso” collection, which features long, clean lines and open structure inspired by modern European furniture design,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaclosets.com/discover-virtuoso|publisher=California Closets website|title=Discover Virtuoso|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref> and the “Tesoro” Italian finishes, which was inspired by materials discovered at the 2011 Milan Furniture Fair and is imported exclusively for California Closets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaclosets.com/california-closets/tesoro-rich-italian-finishes-inspired-fashion|publisher=California Closets website|title=Tesoro: Rich Italian Finishes Inspired By Fashion|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref> The Virtuoso collection was introduced in 2008 and the Tesoro collection followed in 2012.
