It regularly features co-founding ''[[The Intercept]]'' editor and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] as well as senior correspondent, author and journalist [[Naomi Klein]]. The Editor-in-Chief is [[Betsy Reed]].

===Aims and Content===
The aim of the show is to provide independent news and adversarial journalism and discuss important issues. According to Scahill: "Holding those in power accountable, no matter who they are, has always been our mission. With Intercepted, we'll take on a [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] that has already made it clear it intends to wage war against a free press. That, combined with his ambitious extremist agenda to make torture great again, target Muslims, conduct mass deportations and roll back the clock on women's rights to the 1800s, makes our work as journalists more urgent than ever".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilemarketer.com/ex/mobilemarketer/cms/news/media/24377.html|title=The Intercept continues commitment to adversarial journalism with new podcast|date=January 26, 2017|website=Mobile Marketer|author1=Rakin Azfar}}</ref> 

Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed adds that the show: “''Intercepted'' will amplify the stories we cover at ''[[The Intercept]]'', confronting the crucial issues of the moment, from national security to civil liberties, foreign policy to surveillance, at a time of enormous and perilous change in our political environment."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170124006284/en/Intercept-Media-Launch-Podcast-%E2%80%9CIntercepted-Jeremy-Scahill%E2%80%9D|title=The Intercept and First Look Media Launch New Podcast “Intercepted with Jeremy Scahill”|last=|first=|date=January 24, 2017|website=Business Wire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

Scahill continues: "At ''The Intercept'', we believe in holding those in power accountable, and our mission couldn’t be more urgent right now. With [[Donald Trump]] and his cronies consolidating power, we’ve launched a weekly podcast: ''Intercepted''. Every week, I will bring on guests and colleagues to discuss the most pressing stories—those unfolding in public and the ones hidden in the shadows."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/podcasts/|title=Intercepted with Jeremy Scahill|last=|first=|date=|website=The Intercept|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>
