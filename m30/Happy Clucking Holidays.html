'''''Happy Clucking Holidays''''' is a [[comedy]] [[album]] of [[Christmas]] songs performed by Dirk Keysser. Billed as "the greatest album of Christmas music clucked by a human chicken ever," it was originally released in 2002.

==Background==
Keysser, a software services manager at [[Fordham University]] in [[New York City]],<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/fordham_it/about_us/software_services__i/contacts_25118.asp “Fordham IT,” Fordham University]</ref> recorded 14 minutes of material in ten Christmas season songs on ''Happy Clucking Holidays''. He replaced the lyrics with chicken clucking, and used a variety of background musical arrangements.

Keysser has performed chicken-inspired Christmas music twice on the “Is This Anything?” segment of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', clucking “Joy to the World” on December 17, 2002, and “Deck the Halls” on December 17, 2003.<ref>[http://lateshow.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/wahoo/index/php/20031217.phtml “Is This Anything?” Late Show with David Letterman, CBS]</ref>

==Reception==
''Happy Clucking Holidays'' has received somewhat wary reviews. The ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' commented, "You just haven't been annoyed until you've been annoyed by Dirk Keysser clucking out the melody to 'Little Drummer Boy'."<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FF1DCADE4B5DB6B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM “The Holiday Sounds,” November 28, 2003, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (fee access required)]</ref> The ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' remarked, “You have not known fear and hatred until you have heard a man clucking like a chicken to 'Silent Night' - with feeling."<ref>[http://www.anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=16451 “Happy Clucking Holidays,” Anecdotage.com]</ref> 

More positive feedback came from ''[[USA Today]]'' which noted, “The gaping hole in Christmas catalogs for carols sung in a chicken voice is filled by this eclucktic 14-minute collection.” <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-12-16-holiday-music-guide_x.htm “Making a holiday album list,” USA Today, December 18, 2003]</ref> And [[Jack Cafferty]], on the [[CNN]] program ''American Morning'', commented the recording had value “because we're really lacking in Christmas carols sung by a chicken.” <ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19816097_ITM “The Spirit of Regifting,” CNN (transcript), December 25, 2003 (library card access required)]</ref>

==Future releases==
Following the release of ''Happy Clucking Holidays'', Keysser announced plans to release [[poultry]]-inspired albums based on the classical music compositions of [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_/ai_n12748569 “Storyville,” The Independent on Sunday,  December 14, 2003]</ref> To date, however, ''Happy Clucking Holidays'' remains the only recording featuring Keysser’s chicken music.
