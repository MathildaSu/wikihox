'''Emily's Entourage''' is a nonprofit organization that raises money and awareness to help find a cure for rare ("nonsense") mutations of [[cystic fibrosis]] (CF), a genetic disorder that generally affects a person's lungs and digestive system. Emily's Entourage is named after '''Emily Kramer-Golinkoff''', a 30-year-old woman with CF.
