'''Pal Milkovics''' (born 29 July 1979, [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]) is an entrepreneur and investor. He is best known as the CEO of S&P Broadcasting A.S., which is the owner of television group CE Media.

Started his career as radio host and TV reporter; some of his notable works include documentaries about the forgotten children in Chernobyl, the war in Kosovo, and the organ trade in India. In 2003 became editor-in-chief responsible for programme development in RTL Group.

In 2007 he co-founded IEM Group, which started as a garage media company and gradually evolved to a multi-national enterprise with offices in four countries. Pal's main responsibility was new business development and supervision of production processes. Under his management, IEM Group has created various successful TV formats such as documentaries, lifestyle shows and children programmes that have been broadcast all over Europe.

Together with Sami Garam launched the Nordic Food Channel in 2011 with main focus on Finland.

Founded Nordic Media Entertainment in 2012, which controls Czech lifestyle TV channels [http://www.mnam.tv TV Mňam] and TV Mňau through its broadcasting company CE Media.

Milkovics was the Producer of Show [[Leoš Mareš|Leose Marese]] on Tv Prima, which was the first daily late nigh show in the CEE region. The show has been aired for 4 months and achieved good ratings, but a disagreement between him and Tv Prima led to suspend the show. Later the dispute has been settled amicably. <ref>http://www.mediaguru.cz/2015/11/barrandov-presune-bezdruzice-muzeme-mit-i-maresovu-show/#.V7NmlmVLGgE</ref>

After the first year's challenging financial results, CE Media went under financial difficulties in the first quarter of 2016, Milkovics and his business partner has invested their own funds into the company by exiting other businesses. By his tough leadership (letting go 85% of the company staff) CE Media within 6 months recovered, and successfully growing. From 1 July they have started broadcasting with the existing 2 Tv channels in Slovakia, and they are prepared to enter the Hungarian market as well. <ref>http://www.digizone.cz/clanky/pal-milkovics-tezke-casy-skoncily-pripravujeme-nove-projekty/</ref> <ref>http://www.radiotv.cz/p_tv/potrebuje-cesko-dalsi-zpravodajskou-televizi-ma-z24-sanci-na-uspech/</ref>

Milkovics established the first independent news channel in the Czech Republic, called Z24. The TV channel will start its nationwide broadcasting in October 2016. The idea came from the success of the French [[BFM TV]] <ref>http://mam.ihned.cz/media/c1-65355050-milkovics-chce-spustit-novou-zpravodajskou-televizi-mnam-i-mnau-dostanou-novy-vizual</ref>
