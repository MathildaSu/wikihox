== Production ==

The film is set to the fourth movement of [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's seventh symphony]], which has been called "Apotheosis of Dance" by [[Richard Wagner]]. The director's intention was to intercut nature and human structures to show nature overtaking. It was filmed with a tight schedule and the crew travelled long distances in a short amount of time to get many different shots needed. Tuschinski edited the film from six hours of material from "countless camera-angles", as most shots are shown only very briefly due to the often rapid editing. Planning the film, he was inspired by the early works of his friend and mentor [[Hugo Niebeling]] that connect cinematoraphy and music in a very direct way.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://plusinsight.de/2015/06/gold-von-alexander-tuschinski/|title=plusinsight: Interview with Alexander Tuschinski about "Gold." and its premiere at Mykonos Biennale|accessdate=21 June 2015}}.</ref>
