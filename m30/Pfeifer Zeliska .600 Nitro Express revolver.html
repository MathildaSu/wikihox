The '''.600 Nitro Express Zeliska revolver''' is an [[Austria]]n single-action [[revolver]] produced by [[Pfeifer firearms]]. Except for the Giant 1859 28mm Remington revolver, 4.13 feet long,<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKbmTEvyAE&feature=related</ref> and except for the [[Thompson Contender]] .600 Nitro Magnum;<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_X5nyGu5LQ&feature=related</ref>  the Zeliska may be the largest handgun in the world, weighing in at {{convert|6.001|kg|lb|3}} and having a length of {{convert|55|cm|in|0}}. The cylinder section alone weighs {{convert|2.041|kg|lb|3}}. The Zeliska is also one of the most powerful handguns in the world, producing a muzzle energy of 7,591 foot pounds. The weight of the gun helps control the recoil, making controlled shooting possible. The capacity of a Zeliska is five [[.600 Nitro Express]] or [[.458 Winchester Magnum|.458 Win Mag]] rounds. The Zeliska fires a .600 Nitro Express slug (900 grain) at 1,950 ft/s (594.36 m/s, 2,139.7 km/h). The cost of a Zeliska revolver is $17,316. Each .600 Nitro Express round costs $40, making this gun very expensive to fire.

Loading is accomplished through a loading gate located on the right of the cylinder, similar to the [[Colt Single Action Army]], which the Zeliska is largely based on.

Added features to the gun include gold-plated hammer, cylinder pivot, action and the gold-filled inscription on the gun indicating the company's address.
