[[Image:3 Landships vector.svg|thumb|300px|Three types of landships. Top to bottom: sail, wheel and caterpillar types]]

A '''fictional [[landship]]''' is a very large, and [[fiction]]al, [[vehicle]] that travels on land, usually for warfare.

==Fictional description==
In fiction, a landship is a very large [[ship|vessel]] or [[vehicle]] designed for [[travel]] over land. They can be of various sizes, shapes, made of different materials and have different methods of propulsion. Landships are differentiated from normal ground vehicles by their larger sizes and [[complexity]].

Most depictions have landships travelling over fairly flat and stable surfaces such as [[road]]s, [[trail]]s and plain fields, often able to easily ford normal streams and rivers. They tend to be depicted as slow and lumbering, due to an insinuated relatively poor [[power-to-weight ratio]]. Nevertheless, they remain a popular idea due to the visual impressiveness of their great size.

Landships are mostly used for [[exploration]], [[trade]], [[transport]] or [[war]]. They may or may not be armed, but armed ones tend to look like actual [[warship]]s of old, with multiple weapon systems and [[gun turret]]s.

Power sources used in fictional landships tend to vary, ranging from large [[steam engine]]s in [[steampunk]] to things like [[fusion power|fusion reactors]] in [[science fiction]].

The type of solid physical contact maintained with the ground usually comes in the form of large [[continuous track]] or wheel arrays. More imaginative ideas in fiction include [[anti-gravity]] systems and [[Screw-propelled vehicle|screw propulsion]].

=== Land mobile aircraft carrier===
A '''land mobile aircraft carrier''' is a fictional terrestrial vehicle built to launch aircraft while mobile. It is not a launching sled for [[zero length launch|zero-length takeoff systems]]. The concept of a mobile airbase on land has been explored theoretically by many people{{Who|date=January 2010}}, and deemed impractical{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, however this concept appears in some adventure fiction and Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]].

In Japanese animanga, the ''land carrier'', as it is commonly known, is usually accompanied by analogs of other [[navy|wet navy]] [[surface ship]]s, such as [[landship]]s. 

* In [[Gundam]], there are land mobile aircraft carriers and land [[mobile weapons|mobile suit]] carriers.
* In [[Area 88]], there is a converted [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[aircraft carrier]] placed atop converted [[Crawler-Transporter]] drive systems crawling the desert. This carrier also appears as a [[boss (video games)|boss]] in the video game adaptation [[U.N. Squadron]]. 
* In the [[Warhammer 40,000]] novel ''Double Eagle'' by [[Dan Abnett]], the forces of Chaos use land mobile aircraft carriers to launch fighter strikes against retreating Imperial forces.
*In the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Post-apocalyptic]] [[The Amtrak Wars|Amtrak Wars]] universe, giant cross country [[Road train]]s act as mobile forts, their long flat tops acting as runways for [[Ultralight aviation|microlight]] type attack aircraft.
*In [[Armored Core: For Answer]], the Arms Fort "Spirit of Motherwill" is a gigantic, 6-legged multidecked carrier capable of launching Armored Core mecha from its multitude of runways, as well as conventional aircraft. It is also heavily armed with two three gun turrets mounting highly accurate 25 feet caliber guns, several cruise-missile launchers on the edges of the flight decks as well as what appears to be Bofors 40mm AA cannons mounted in dozens of twin gun turrets along the edges of each flight deck. It also carries hilariously thick armor, but contains structural flaws that eventually results in its destruction at the hands of the player.
*Arms Fort "Great Wall", a moving fortress with the appearance of an outrageously oversized armored train, has a large open deck on its rearmost "car"
*Arms Fort "Cabracan", holds several unmanned areial vehicles in its superstructure, it holds little in common with the SoMW, but it is more than able to fill the role of a "landcarrier".
*And in the [[videogame]] [[Haze video game|Haze]], Mantel Industries use a land carrier as their base of operations in the field. 
*In the videogame Supreme Commander, the UEF experimental tank Fatboy can repair and refuel aircraft, but can not build them. It can, however, keep one aircraft parked on each of its two pads.

Although not formally land mobile aircraft carriers, films and television series have also depicted [[helicopter]] and [[VTOL]] aircraft launches from [[semi-trailer]]s and [[railroad car]]s.Concept art for the video game Command and conquer: Renegade featured an ORCA VTOL combat aircraft taking off from a converted 18-Wheeler, based on the scrapped concept from the original Command and Conquer.

==Fictional appearances==
Due to their large sizes, landships are considered to be impractical in real life (except for [[tank]]s and other [[armored fighting vehicles]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}). However, they are featured in works of fiction, as land-based counterparts of water ships and [[airship]]s.

===Books, comics and manga===
* [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Land Ironclads]]'' (1904) predated and inspired the development of the tank (see [[Landships Committee]]).
* [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[Escape on Venus]] (1946) features warring fleets of landships called "neolantars".  The largest vessels are described as between seven hundred and eight hundred feet long, with a beam of over a hundred feet, and a height of at least thirty feet above the ground, with lighter superstructures rising another thirty feet or more.
* [[Robert A. Heinlein]] described "land cruisers," large cannon-armed vehicles in "[[If This Goes Onâ€”]]".
* [[Michael Moorcock]]'s ''The Revenge of the Rose'' features the cities of the Gypsy Nation travelling around the equator of a world powered by slave muscle. His novel ''[[The Land Leviathan]]'' also features a massive land vehicle.
* [[Phillip Reeve]]'s ''[[Mortal Engines Quartet]]'' features [[Traction City|Traction Cities]], mobile [[human settlement]]s carrying up to entire city populations.
* [[Fyodor Berezin]]'s "Battle Mountain"-class aka "[[sow]]" [[air-cushioned landing craft|air-cushioned]] artillery battleship carrying squads of tanks (nicknamed as [[pigs]]), mentioned in [[The Huge Black Ship]] trilogy
* [[Keith Laumer]]'s [[Bolo (tank)|Bolo]] series features powerful tanks, the larger models of which are able to assault or defend planets.
* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune universe]] "[[List_of_Dune_ships#Harvester_or_Harvester_Factory|Harvesters]]" up to 120 m long harvest the [[Melange_(fictional_drug)|spice]] on the planet [[Arrakis]].
* [[Gundam]] features "land battleships" in nearly every series to date, typically bearing [[battleship]]-style [[artillery battery]] arrangements. While varying in size according to series (and sometimes even within a series), they tend to be treated as mobile headquarters by various factions.
* [[Wind on Fire]] features a desert patrolled by two wind-driven rolling cities, Ombaraka and Omchaka. They are entirely self-sufficient, even carrying onboard farms, and use small unmanned blade-armed landships as weapons against each other.
* Lieutenant Nathaniel Flint is a [[steampunk]] Landship Lieutenant whose specialized landship allows him to go about being an armored escort. Flint as well as the Landship Scorpios are featured in a short-story series written by Nathan Powell. Nate has also written a fictional class system that goes into detail about fictional Landships. The Scorpios features two giant drills that makes it a submarine-esque landship, as well as a noticeably large cannon specializing in anti-aircraft combat. see www.facebook.com/landship
* The city in ''Road of Skulls'' (''[[The State of the Art]]'') by [[Iain M Banks]] is in constant motion.

===Television and film===
*''[[Secret of Cerulean Sand]]'' and ''[[Now and Then, Here and There]]'' are examples of anime that feature landships.
*''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' had two [[List of Thunderbirds episodes|episodes]] featuring road-building landships called [[Thunderbirds machines#Roadlayer|Roadlayers]]. The [[Thunderbirds_machines#Crablogger|Crablogger]] and [[Thunderbirds_machines#Sidewinder|Sidewinder]] could also be considered walking landships.
* The ''[[Ark II]]'' featured in a short run 1976 TV series was a cross-country vehicle manned by young survivors of an ecological disaster carrying a storehouse of knowledge.
* The Landmasters in the 1977 film ''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'', based on [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1969 [[Damnation Alley|novel]], were two large USAF cross-country all-terrain vehicles used by a group of survivors of a nuclear war.
*''[[Star Wars]]''' Sandcrawlers traverse the dunes of desert planet [[Tatooine]].
* The ''Citadel'' in the 2001 movie [[Avalon (2001 film)|Avalon]].
* [[John Carter of Mars]] ([[Barsoom]]) features city-sized land-ships with [[metachronal rhythm]]-[[centipedal]] locomotion
* The Japanese manga series [[Gundam]] feature several land-ships, like in Gundam Seed and her spin-offs. Here, large ships use a form of repulsor to literally 'sail' the Sahara Desert .

===Computer and video games===
*''[[Heavy Gear]]'' has large factions who maintain entire navies of landships, ranging from the size of a tugboat to twice the volume of a [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier]].
*''[[Supreme Commander (game)|Supreme Commander]]'' features the UEF faction's "Fatboy" mobile factory, a prime example of a landship.
*''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' and ''[[Unreal Tournament 3]]'' have the Leviathan, a pilotable wheeled landship.
*''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' had large landships, hybrids of [[pirate ship]]s with caterpillar tracks.

*''[[Command & Conquer]]'' features large vehicles prominently throughout, such as the ''Tiberium'' series' GDI "Mammoth" tanks. The series' record appears to stand with ''[[Command and Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath]]'' and its ''Mammoth Armed Reclamation Vehicle'', which has enough space for a turret with triple sonic cannons, four auxiliary turrets and an internal tiberium refinery.
*''[[Valkyria Chronicles]]'' features a "land dreadnought" of gargantuan size called the Marmota.
*''[[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]]'' features a huge land battleship called the Cocoon controlled by AI.
*''[[Killzone 3]]'' features a level that takes place on a mobile factory landship tasked with recycling metal in a massive junkyard..
*''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' features vehicles known as "Carrier Tanks", visible during the Mann vs. Machine game mode. They do not attack the players directly, but deploy robots to attack players.
*''[[Halo 4]]'' features a 70 m long six-wheeled vehicle called a "Mammoth" (formally the ''Mobile Anti-Aircraft Weapons Platform M510 Siegework/Ultra-Heavy''), which acts partially as a troop and vehicle carrier, but also sports a [[Gauss gun]] turret that is used to destroy multiple enemy warships and is stated to have the capacity to engage ''suborbital'' targets.
*''[[Battle Isle (series)]]'' features heavily armed and armoured "Mobile Fortress" and "Mobile Bunker" units, the latter of which being available to transport other units.
