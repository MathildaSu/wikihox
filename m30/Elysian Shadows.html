== Setting ==
Limited information has been revealed regarding the storyline of Elysian Shadows, although the developers have been vocal in insisting that the game was originally conceived as a storyline concept and that plot and character progression would be the central focus of the RPG.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K56mndHzpQc|title=Adventures in Game Development Chapter 24 |publisher=youtube.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2014-04-09}}</ref>

=== World and Story ===
[[File:Elysian Shadows Screen Shot.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of the protagonist, Julien, standing in Loren's Market.]]
Elysian Shadows takes place in a land known as Asphodel, playing host to a diverse set of biomes, including forests, caves, mountains, jungles, plains, tundra, and a variety of ancient ruins. The societies of Asphodel are caught in constant conflict between magic and technology, as the religious sects have been bestowed with the gifts of magic, while the intellectual sects are forced to turn to science and technology in their day-to-day lives. Upon uncovering a long-lost artifact in an ancient ruin, players find themselves thrust into the middle of this rising conflict to maintain the status quo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nichegamer.net/2014/04/discover-a-world-separated-by-magic-and-technology-in-elysian-shadows/|title=Discover a World Separated by Magic and Technology in Elysian Shadows |accessdate=2014-05-26 |publisher=nichgamer.com | date=2014-04-20}}</ref>

In addition to a lush overworld, Asphodel also plays host to a variety of different underground ruins scattered about the lands. These ruins are excavated by "diggers" and scholars seeking to uncover their ancient secrets and hidden treasures. While the backstory of these ruins has not yet been revealed, they will play a major role in the plot progression of Elysian Shadows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elysianshadows.com/game/information/|title=Official World of Elysian Shadows|publisher=elysianshadows.com |accessdate=2014-05-26}}</ref>

Various pieces of concept art for the ruins and their inhabitants have been posted by the team to social media sites, and the developers have announced during interviews that at least one of these ruins will be survival-horror themed, inspired by [[Resident Evil]] and [[Ocarina of Time]]'s Shadow Temple.<ref name="twodashstash.com">{{cite web|url=http://twodashstash.com/2014/05/indie-stash-cast-falco-girgis-tyler-rogers-talk-elysian-shadows-developing-dreamcast-answer-questions/|title=Indie Stash Cast: Falco Girgis and Tyler Rogers Talk Elysian Shadows, Developing for the Dreamcast, and Answer Your Questions |accessdate=2014-05-26 |publisher=twodashstash.com | date=2014-05-20}}</ref>

=== Main characters ===
While the complete party has never officially been revealed, various party members have been released at one point or another through episodes of "[[#Adventures in Game Development|Adventures in Game Development]]," or on the team's official social media pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.410087505701567.88557.201764123200574&type=3|title=Facebook - Party Concepts |accessdate=2014-05-26 |publisher=facebook.com | date=2012-06-21}}</ref><ref name="GyroVorbis YouTube Channel">{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/gyrovorbis|title=GyroVorbis YouTube Channel|accessdate=2014-05-26|date=2008-08-07}}</ref>

* '''Julien''' is the main protagonist of Elysian Shadows. He is revealed to be a digger living in Loren, uncovering artifacts for the local museum. His name was reportedly inspired by the team's favorite band, [[Julien-K]].

* '''Eryn''' is the female protagonist of Elysian Shadows. She also lives in Loren and runs the local museum, studying ancient artifacts with her father. She has been said to be a strong female lead, inspired by Lucca of [[Chrono Trigger]] and [[Lara Croft]] of [[Tomb Raider]].

* '''Angel (name not known)''' has been teased as a third party member during an episode of [[#Adventures in Game Development|Adventures in Game Development]]. Nothing has been revealed of her backstory, but her sprite has been shown displaying a prominent pair of wings.

== Style and Influences ==

=== Visuals ===
[[File:Elysian Shadows.png|thumb|left|3D Perspective and Dynamic Lights in Loren's Church.]] 
Graphically, Elysian Shadows uses mostly [[pixel art]] in the style of 16-bit RPGs, with slightly higher resolutions. The team has cited console RPGs such as [[Chrono Trigger]], [[Secret of Mana]], and [[Phantasy Star]] as artistic inspiration; however, unlike other games of the genre, Elysian Shadows features advanced lighting techniques such as [[shadow mapping]], [[normal mapping]], and [[specular highlights|specular highlighting]].<ref name="https">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMsB17loGcY|title=Adventures in Game Development Chapter 21 |publisher=youtube.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2014-01-13}}</ref> The environments are also rendered in full 3D, which allows the game to dynamically change between 2D orthographic and 3D perspectives during cutscenes or other in-game events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elysian-shadows.wikia.com/wiki/Elysian_Shadows|title=Unofficial Elysian Shadows Wiki |accessdate=2014-05-26 |publisher=wikia.com | date=2014-03-27}}</ref>

According to the official website, the team's mission for the visuals of ES is {{quote|"[..] to push the boundaries of pixel art by creating diverse, lush environments for players to explore with beautifully lit scenes and advanced rendering effects that could not have been possible on older hardware."|Elysian Shadows Team|[http://elysianshadows.com/game/information/ Elysian Shadows Official Website, Game Information]}}

=== Audio ===
Similar to the graphical style, the audio of Elysian Shadows is also a fusion of old and new. Background music dynamically changes in intensity to match the player's environment, and sound effects are positional, in full 3D. The soundtrack uses vintage electronic music hardware with modern synthesizer software, resulting in songs with a distinct 16-bit chiptune-style mixed with a variety of instruments, choirs, and electronic sounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elysianshadows.com/game/information/|title=Official - Music, 3D positional & dynamic |publisher=elysianshadows.com |accessdate=2014-05-26}}</ref> In his blog posts and during [[#Adventures in Game Development|Adventures in Game Development]], composer [[Connor Linning]] has sampled various beats and sounds from popular [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo]] games, including [[Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Harvest Moon]], and [[Donkey Kong Country]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connorlinning.com/2014/01/26/elysian-shadows-soundtrack-development-blog-2/|title=Elysian Shadows Soundtrack Development Blog 2 |accessdate=2014-05-26 |publisher=ConnorLinning.com | date=2014-01-26}}</ref>

=== Gameplay ===
Elysian Shadows' gameplay has drawn influence from a wide variety of games, many of which aren't even RPGs. The RPG aspects of Elysian Shadows have been said to be primarily inspired by 16-bit [[Squaresoft]], [[Enix]], and [[Sega]] RPGs, while the adventure aspects of the game have been primarily influenced by the [[Legend of Zelda]] series, with an emphasis on environmental interaction and rewarding overworld exploration.<ref name="youtube.com"/> Additionally, the game includes [[Platform game|platformer]] gameplay mechanics such as dashing and jumping not usually found in top-down RPGs. The team believes these mechanics will open exploration up into the third dimension and will make combat more interesting, citing the speed and agility of the [[Megaman X]] series. The team has referred to the battle engine as a marriage between the [[Secret of Mana]] and the [[God of War]] series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/elysianshadows/photos/pb.201764123200574.-2207520000.1401124606./730020550374926/?type=3&theater|title=Combat Engine Facebook Post |publisher=facebook.com |accessdate=2014-05-26}}</ref>

During a podcast interview, the team mentioned that the recurring theme of scattered underground ruins in the world of Asphodel was inspired by the [[Megaman Legends]] series, and that their composer's primary source of inspiration comes from the survival horror genre and franchises like [[Resident Evil]] and [[Silent Hill]].<ref name="twodashstash.com"/>

== Development ==
Development on Elysian Shadows is widely regarded to have started Oct 7, 2007, as this is when the first Chapter of the "[[#Adventures in Game Development|Adventures in Game Development]]" series was uploaded to [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iimLO5UkWYg|title=Adventures in Game Development Chapter 1 |publisher=youtube.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2007-08-07}}</ref> Going by date, the game has been in development for almost 7 years, and this number is often cited by critics regarding the game's lengthy development cycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.micromania.es/noticias/elysian-shadows-7-anos-desarrollo-indie|title=Elysian Shadows: 7 años de desarrollo indie |publisher=micromania.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |date=2014-04-09}}</ref> The team has publically dismissed the "7 year" estimate during interviews, as it is claimed that they were just kids in their parents' attics at the time, with no development experience, and much of the time has been spent growing into their roles as game developers. In addition to time spent on the actual game, the team also cites time spent developing their own engine, tools, and multiplatform library, further bloating this figure. They have also taken several extended breaks throughout development, as many of their members are attending graduate school and work full-time jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coreelementspodcast.blogspot.com/2014/05/ce-61-elysian-shadows.html|title=Core Elements 61: Elysian Shadows|publisher=http://coreelementspodcast.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2014-05-09}}</ref>

=== Publisher ===

On 26th May 2014, the team shared on their Facebook page that developers of [[Pier Solar]] Water Melon Co has contacted the team about possibly publishing Elysian Shadows.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/elysianshadows/photos/a.261525073891145.61859.201764123200574/748968801813434/?type=1</ref> The press release did not say that a deal has been finalized, merely discussed the possibility.

=== Sega Dreamcast Support ===
Elysian Shadows began as an an RPG exclusively for the [[Sega Dreamcast]], but the engine was quickly ported to many more platforms as the [[#Adventures in Game Development|Adventures in Game Development]] [[YouTube]] series rose in popularity. With the inclusion of advanced shading techniques in Elysian Shadows' visuals, the team has stated many times that the game will be pushing the console to its limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=4814&start=50|title=Dreamcast-Talk Elysian Shadows Discussion Thread |publisher=dreamcast-talk.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2012-07-24}}</ref>  The limited resources on the Dreamcast have often been the target of many jokes throughout the [[#Adventures in Game Development|Adventures in Game Development]] series, as the team has stated that the development builds frequently run out of [[texture memory]]. They have also joked that players may have to manually free memory resources allocated to scripts when the framerate drops.<ref name="https"/>

While the [[Sega Dreamcast]] is no longer the sole-focus of the Elysian Shadows project, the lead engine developer, [[Falco Girgis]], insists that Elysian Shadows continues to support the aging console, calling it his "quest" to release a game for the platform he grew up developing for.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JN90aCRuQI|title=The Week in Geek - Episode 5|publisher=youtube.com |accessdate=2014-05-28 |date=2014-05-19}}</ref>

=== Technology ===
The majority of the technology behind Elysian Shadows has been developed in-house by the team, including the Engine, Toolkit, and platform-independent driver back-end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elysianshadows.com/game/information/|title=Official - Powering the Future of the 2D RPG|publisher=elysianshadows.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2014-04-09}}</ref>

==== ESGamma ====
ESGamma is the proprietary engine developed in-house to power Elysian Shadows. It is written in [[C++11]] and links against the [[#LibGyro|LibGyro]] API to achieve platform independence. The engine boasts full 3D dynamic lighting, 2D and 3D dynamic cameras, 2D rigid-body physics, advanced particle effects, bump and specular maps, and shadow mapping. It is fully extensible through the [[Lua (programming language)|Lua scripting language]], which allows the Elysian Shadows team to create and script custom contents and events for the world of Elysian Shadows in a manner similar to Behavior Scripts in the [[Unity3D]] engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elysianshadows.com/game/information/|title=Official - ESGamma|publisher=elysianshadows.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2014-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiI59XlCeK0|title=Adventures in Game Development Chapter 20|publisher=youtube.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2012-04-08}}</ref>

==== ESToolkit ====
ESToolkit or "ESTk" is a 2D level editing and creation tool developed by the Elysian Shadows team to create the environments for Elysian Shadows. It is developed in [[C++11]] with the [[Qt (software)|Qt framework]] and is said to share a significant amount of code with ESGamma. ESTk offers advanced editing features for developing environments using tilesheets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elysianshadows.com/game/information/|title=Official - ESToolkit|publisher=elysianshadows.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2014-04-09}}</ref> It also contains an entity/component editor that was influenced by the [[Unity3D]] editor. One of its most well-known features is the ability to give flat tiles "elevation" information within the levels, allowing the team to create 3D levels for Elysian Shadows using only 2D assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecjtXlo89K0|title=Elysian Shadows Live Stream #3|publisher=youtube.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2013-05-25}}</ref>

==== LibGyro ====
LibGyro is a platform-independent multimedia API written in C, providing interfaces for rendering, device input, audio, asset management, linear algebra, and system management. These interfaces are implemented as statically-linked libraries on various platforms, including [[Dreamcast|Sega Dreamcast]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Ouya]], which are then linked against the ESGamma engine, allowing it to remain truly platform-independent through compile-time and link-time [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elysianshadows.com/game/information/|title=Official - libGyro|publisher=elysianshadows.com |accessdate=2014-05-26 |date=2014-04-09}}</ref> It has been demonstrated at various times throughout the "[[#Adventures in Game Development|Adventures in Game Development]]" series that the linear algebra library implementation for at least the x86 and [[Dreamcast|Sega Dreamcast]] platforms are assembly-optimized to take advantage of [[SIMD]] instructions for vector and matrix processing. LibGyro has enabled the Elysian Shadows team to easily move the game to various platforms without ever requiring engine rewrites or modifications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/falcogirgis|title=Falco Girigs LinkedIn - libGyro Project|publisher=linkedin.com |accessdate=2014-05-26}}</ref>

=== Adventures in Game Development ===
[[File:AiGD.jpg|thumb|Elysian Shadows Team releasing ESTkv1.5.2 in AiGD Chapter 20]]
"Adventures in Game Development" is an ongoing [[YouTube]] [[video blog]] series uploaded to GyroVorbis's Channel, giving viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the life of indie game developers, by chronicling the development of the Elysian Shadows 2D RPG from start to finish. The majority of the videos are filmed in the style of a reality television series, with limited post-production and editing effects, and a raw, uncut presentation.<ref name="GyroVorbis YouTube Channel"/> The series is well-known for its adult humor, caffeine abuse, lack of sleep, and dysfunctional antics. Despite this fact, many of the videos dive into great technical detail and the series is viewed by many as being partially educational.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/i-m-into-adventures-in-game-development-273218.phtml|title=I'm into Adventures in Game Development|accessdate=2014-05-26|publisher=destructoid.com|date=2014-04-14}}</ref>

While the series has historically been mostly programming-oriented, the latest Chapters attempt to follow all aspects of game development, including coding, art, music, and design.

====Accidental Success====
While the series has been highly successful as a game development video blog on YouTube, with over 9k subscribers as of May 2014, the team has admitted that this success was purely accidental in a recent podcast interview. Chapters 1-3 were apparently recorded with the purpose of being end-game unlockable content, inspired by the developer videos at the end of [[God of War]]. The team was shocked to find a positive reaction to the original videos on YouTube, and they decided to continue documenting their development progress on YouTube, transforming the series into a [[video blog]].<ref name="twodashstash.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://coreelementspodcast.blogspot.com/2014/05/ce-61-elysian-shadows.html|title=Core Elements 61: Elysian Shadows|publisher=http://coreelementspodcast.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=2014-05-08 |date=2014-05-09}}</ref>

====Chapter Summaries====
Adventures in Game Development is released periodically as a series of "Chapters," with "Adventures in Game Development Chapter 25" being the latest release.

He then creates the "Adventure Log," for displaying in-game quest information, and uses it for debug output. Peter demonstrates using a restorative item and a demo ice-skating rink area created with Lua. Falco later introduces the "Lua Debug Prompt," allowing Lua code to be typed and executed in-game as a debugging mechanism. Rachel shows viewers her development setup and her interior tiles. Falco's parody nerd persona, "XxStillAVirgin69xX" makes his first appearance, poking fun at Falco's pretentious classmates. The episode ends with a musical montage of Falco, Marcel, and Peter demonstrating various engine and toolkit features.

| After an in-game intro, Falco demonstrates the current build running on the Dreamcast and gets mad at Peter for generating so many particles that the internal vertex buffers were being overwritten. After putting a cap on the particle emission intensity, he discusses adding, removing, and triggering items and inventory through Lua. Marcel implements a region-fill feature into his level editor. Peter and Marcel create a battle system prototype completely in Lua. Falco describes preprocessor directives used to support render calls on both the Dreamcast and PC and introduces the team's new website. The Chapter ends with a full in-game parody sidequest, staring Luigi navigating through a dungeon with his head chopped off and particle blood spurting everywhere. After facing off against a few Dragon Quest slimes to the Poke'mon theme, and conversing with various sprite cameos, the quest ends with Luigi walking in on Peter watching porn in a secret room.

|November 29–30, 2008 and February 1, 2009
| Chapter 15 is the only Chapter to focus on minigames developed using the Elysian Shadows engine, rather than focusing on the Elysian Shadows game itself. Peter begins by creating a full-fledged Chu-Chu Rocket clone while Marcel continues working on the level editor. Falco discusses how to implement polling logic entirely in Lua, while Jools shows off his latest work on the forest tilesheet. The team then creates a concoction of Italian dressing, hot sauce, raspberry flavor concentrate, and maple syrup, announcing that the team member with the most mistakes caught on camera would have to drink it. The team spends the remainder of the video developing a Super Mario Bros. clone using the Elysian Shadows tools, and Marcel ultimately winds up having to drink the concoction.

| The video starts off with Marcel entering the Elysian Shadows level editor into the local Science Fair competition. After the team examines his display and demos the level editor, Marcel winds up winning a bunch of rewards and earns an invitation to the International Science Fair. Afterwards, Falco introduces the NPC action queue and walks through its Lua implementation. Kendall is introduced as Falco's girlfriend, and she talks about her work for the university. Peter experiments with adding 759 onscreen NPCs, trying to slow down the engine. The video ends with Falco being forced to run through the streets naked, after losing a bet with Kendall.

|August 13–14, 2010
| After the team spent nearly a year creating a new side series entitled "Elysian Shadows Revolution," Chapter 17 marked the team's comeback to the original series. While Chapter 17 did include some of the commentary and post-production emphasis of the ESRev series, it was toned down considerably, as the team tried to return to a more raw format. The video is centered around the Elysian Shadows Team continuing development on their tools and their friends, Dual-Thread studios working on their various Unity3D projects. The OSX build of Elysian Shadows is introduced for the first time, and Falco discusses the Unity3D engine's influences on the Elysian Shadows engine. Marcel introduces the newest rendition of the Elysian Shadows level editor, which would go on to be known as "ESTk" in later Chapters. Tyler is introduced as a gameplay scripter and writer for ES.

|April 7, 2012
| Nearly a year and a half after the release of Chapter 17, Chapters 18-20 were released back-to-back as a comeback for the team and series. These three Chapters had a larger emphasis on documentary-style commentary by each team member and featured more post-production video editing than the previously seen in the series. They also focus around the revamping of the Toolkit, ESTk. After an "Epic Meal-Time" shopping parody, the team reunites, announcing James and Jarrod of Dual-Threat as new recruits for the project. The episode takes a much darker turn, once the team settles down and begins testing the current ESTk build on every platform. The remainder of the episode focuses on the team overhauling ESTk, addressing the various random instabilities, unreasonable load-times, and poorly-designed widgets of the Toolkit.

|April 8, 2012
| Chapter 19 was the second in a sequence of 3 chapters detailing the revamp of ESTk. The episode focuses around the team releasing ESTk1.5.1. The team tries to implement a paper-based map concept in the new Toolkit and begins storyboarding the intro cutscene. The software team implements tile attribute modification widgets, recolors the UI, integrates the engine, and implements tile flipping and rotation. Falco provides a whiteboard lecture on tile flipping and rotation.  James creates logos and various icon art for the Toolkit. Falco and Marcel implement a multi-tiered debugging mechanism to log and categorize errors sourced from ESTk or the Engine. The episode ends with a Facebook selfie and the internal release of ESTk1.5.1.

|April 8, 2012
| Chapter 20 was the last bulk-released episode detailing the revamp of ESTk. The episode focuses around the team releasing ESTkv1.5.2, beginning with the introduction of trendy icons, map zoom and scale, and Unity3D-influenced entity/component modification. James creates a new splash screen, and Marcel and Jarrod create History View and provide a lecture detailing its design. Falco and Jarrod implement adding and removing levels with an asterisk signifying the level has been modified without being saved. The team ends with a group Facebook selfie, and the internal release of ESTkv1.5.2, the most stable, feature-rich build yet.

|January 31, 2014
| After a nearly two-year break from the series, the team returns with a full feature-length episode, announcing that the series will be returning to its old, raw pre-Chapter 16 style. An Elysian Shadows Kickstarter campaign is also announced for the end of the summer. Significant progress is displayed on the engine, with the introduction of an entire dynamic lighting engine, advanced pathfinding algorithms, and 3D positional audio system by Falco and Tyler. Connor Linning is introduced as the new audio composer for the project, and he describes the team's vision for having dynamic audio, affected by tension in the player's environment. Falco gives a drunken lecture on using SSE-instructions to hardware-accelerate matrix operations on the CPU, rather than incurring BUS transfer overhead and performing the calculations on the GPU.

|February 9, 2014
| Peter is seen for a brief Rock Band reunion with Falco for the first time since Chapter 16. Falco and Tyler have over a random YouTube fan to dev with them. Falco completes his work with omnidirectional shadow mapping by using invisible 3D shadow volume prisms for sprites and implements a first-person perspective camera, demoing the levels in full 3D. Tyler continues working on his A* pathfinding algorithm and begins prototyping the combat system. Patrick begins working on the Loren Forest tilesheet. The team announces that Elysian Shadows would use both 2D and 3D perspectives.

|March 9, 2014
| Falco begins working on a dynamic day/night system, and supporting more than 4 simultaneous dynamic lights through multipass rendering. Tyler shows off a draft for the forest map on graphing paper, Patrick completes the pixel art and level design for the entrance to Loren Forest, and Connor composes the Elysian Shadows title screen theme. Falco later integrates his Dreamcast-based particle demo into the engine and reimplements the dialog box seen in past chapters. Tyler creates new spell effects using the dynamic lighting engine.

|April 9, 2014
| Falco implements a full 2D rigid-body physics engine and specular highlights within ESGamma then creates a demo with spell effects applying forces to selective particles and rigid bodies. Tyler begins working on a new enemy, "Ziggy the Unamused." Connor samples the drums in the "Metropolis Zone" theme from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for a new track. Andrew is introduced as an iOS developer and gets the iOS build compiling during a Skype chat. Leandro is introduced as a new artists and works on the ice caves. Falco and Tyler also show off their design document binder and tease many gameplay and storyline influences to the audience.

|May 19, 2014
| Falco and Tyler switch focus from R&D to gameplay development. Falco implements platforming mechanics, moves the particle system to 3D, and begins scripting environments while Tyler works on the battle engine. Connor composes three new tracks, Patrick creates an enemy concept, and Leandro shows off his pixel work on cave and sky ruins maps.  Daniel is introduced as a web developer/level designer. The team ultimately integrates the physics with the battle engine and allows the player to pick up and throw objects in the environment as a combat tactic.
