[[Autism spectrum]] disorders (ASDs) were first identified by [[Hans Asperger]] and [[Leo Kanner]] in 1943, and it was not until many years later that they were formally recognised by the medical community. Journalists, academics and autism professionals have speculated that certain famous or notable historical people had [[autistic disorder|autism]] or other autism spectrum disorders such as [[Asperger syndrome]]. Such speculations are often disputed. For example, several autism researchers speculate that [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was autistic or otherwise [[neurodivergent]], while other researchers say there is not sufficient evidence to draw such conclusions.<ref name=JankovicMozart/><ref name=JamesSingular/> [[Temple Grandin]], a professor who is herself autistic, speculates that very early inventions like the stone spear were probably the work of autistic [[Neanderthal|cavemen]].<ref name=Grandin>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongplanet.net/article295.html |title=Interview with Temple Grandin |publisher=Wrong Planet |date=January 2, 2006<!-- year deduced from dated weekdays in the article, consistent with earliest wayback --> |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060927084556/http://www.wrongplanet.net/article295.html |archivedate=September 27, 2006}}</ref><ref name=NewYork>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/|title=The Autism Rights Movement|author=Andrew Solomon|publisher=New York|date=2008-05-25}}</ref>

== Specific individuals==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H1216-0500-002, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Adolf Hitler]]]]
[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727), [[Nikola Tesla]] (1856-1943), [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955), and [[Adolf Hitler]] (1889-1945) all died before [[Asperger syndrome]] became known, but [[Ioan James]],<ref name=JamesSingular/> Michael Fitzgerald,<ref name=FitzGenesis/> and [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]<ref name=newsci>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn3676|title=Einstein and Newton showed signs of autism|date=April 30, 2003|publisher=New Scientist|author=Hazel Muir|accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> believe their personalities are consistent with those of people with Asperger syndrome. [[Tony Attwood]] has also named Einstein as a likely case of mild autism.<ref name=AttwoodStrat/>

Not everyone agrees with these analyses. According to [[Oliver Sacks]], the evidence that any one of these figures had autism "seems very thin at best".<ref name=SacksCavendish/> Glen Elliott, a psychiatrist at the [[University of California at San Francisco]], is unconvinced that either Newton or Einstein had Asperger syndrome, particularly due to the unreliability of diagnoses based on biographical information. Elliot stated that there are a variety of causes that could explain the behaviour in question, and points out that Einstein is known to have had a good sense of humour, a trait that, according to Elliot, is "virtually unknown in people with severe Asperger syndrome".<ref name=newsci/>

===Isaac Newton===
Isaac Newton hardly spoke and had few friends. He was often so absorbed in his work that he forgot to eat, demonstrating an obsessive single-mindedness that is commonly associated with Asperger's. If nobody attended his lessons, he reportedly gave lectures to an empty room. When he was 50, he suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[paranoia]].<ref name=newsci/> After Newton's death, however, his body was found to contain massive amounts of mercury, probably from his alchemical pursuits, which could have accounted for his eccentricity in later life.<ref>[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Newton.html Newton, Isaac.] Scienceworld.com.  Retrieved on 2008-03-09.</ref>

===Nikola Tesla===
In Nikola Tesla's autobiography, ''My Inventions'', he claims to have the ability to "visualize with the greatest facility", allowing him to fully design and test his inventions in his mind:

{{bq|text=It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatever, the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tesla |first=Nikola |year=2007 |origyear=first published 1919 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qcAoK07arLYC&pg=PA19 |title=My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla |publisher=Wilder Publications |page=19 |isbn=1934451770}}</ref><ref name=GeniusGenes/>}}

Tesla also displayed other suggestive behaviours, according to Fitzgerald, such as reclusiveness, obsessiveness (sometimes working for two or three days without sleep), limited sense of humour, and lack of empathy.<ref name=GeniusGenes/>

===Albert Einstein===
Albert Einstein is sometimes thought to have had Asperger syndrome, despite forming close relationships with a number of people, marrying twice, and being outspoken on pro-social political issues. According to Baron-Cohen, "passion, falling in love and standing up for justice are all perfectly compatible with Asperger syndrome",<ref name=newsci/> although he notes that Einstein's delayed language development and educational slowness may be more indicative of high-functioning autism.<ref name=JamesAS/>

Fitzgerald describes Einstein's interest in physics as "an addiction", and says that it was important for him to be in control of his life. He also points to Einstein's occasionally perceived lack of tact, social empathy, and naivety, as further apparent traits he had in common with people with autism spectrum disorders.<ref name=GeniusGenes/> Ioan James adds that Einstein was much better at processing visual information than verbal; Einstein himself once said "I rarely think in words at all".<ref name=JamesAS/>

In her 1995 book ''In a World of His Own: A Storybook About Albert Einstein'', author [[Illana Katz]] notes that Einstein "was a loner, solitary, suffered from major tantrums, had no friends and didn't like being in crowds", and conjectures that he may have had some form of autism.<ref>{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Illana|date=May 26, 2005|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|title=Does Autism Offer Special Gifts?|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/education/article/does_autism_offer_special_gifts_20050527/}}</ref>

By contrast, the economist [[Thomas Sowell]] claims that Einstein actually had a condition that he termed Einstein syndrome and was not autistic.  Sowell states that Einstein syndrome includes delayed speech development, intellectual giftedness, and no dramatic impairments in mental functioning during adulthood.<ref name= "Sowell"> {{cite book | first = Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Sowell| last = Sowell | title = The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late | pages = 89–150 | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-465-08140-1 }}</ref>  Dr. Stephen Camarata, a professor at Vanderbilt School of Medicine, said that if Einstein was diagnosed as autistic, it would be misidentifying him despite his late talking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Minutes with Stephen Camarata|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/five-minutes-stephen-camarata|website=The MIT Press|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>  Additionally, [[Walter Isaacson]], in a book about Einstein, has doubted the validity of an autism diagnosis for Einstein, writing that "Einstein made close friends, had passionate relationships, enjoyed collegial discussions, communicated well verbally, and could empathize with friends and humanity in general."<ref name= "Isaacson"> {{cite book | first = Walter |authorlink=Walter Isaacson| last = Isaacson | title = Einstein: His Life and Universe | page = 566n | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780786295289 }}</ref>
