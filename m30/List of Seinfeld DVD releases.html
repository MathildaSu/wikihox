All seasons of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' have been released on DVD by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]. Unlike some other 1990s sitcom DVD releases, they contain quite comprehensive extras, including bloopers (labeled "Not That There's Anything Wrong With That"), a trivia track for every episode("Notes about Nothing"); and short featurettes ("Inside Looks"), audio commentaries ("Yada Yada Yada"), and [[Traditional animation#Animatic|animatics]] ("Sein-imations" by [[Eric Yahnker]]) for select episodes. The seasons have been sorted into 'volumes' for their DVD release, with seasons 1 and 2 forming 'Volume 1' (a total of 18 episodes) and each subsequent season was released in a single volume.

While the box sets listed below are the predominant retail versions, variations have occurred: 
*Seasons 1, 2 & 3 were available in a gift set which came with a script, salt and pepper shakers and a [[napkin dispenser]]. In Australia, it was only available with season 4.<ref>[http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/778811 Seinfeld - Complete Season 4: Limited Edition Gift Set (4 Disc Box Set) @ EzyDVD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*Seasons 5 & 6 were available in a combined box set, which also included a miniature replica "puffy shirt".<ref>[http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/783810 Seinfeld - Complete Season 5 And 6: Limited Edition Gift Set (Box Set) @ EzyDVD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
