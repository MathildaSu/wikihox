Speculation over potential '''nominations''' to the '''[[Supreme Court of the United States]]''' by a [[President of the United States|President]] '''[[Hillary Clinton]]''' has been fueled by statements that Clinton has made during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential campaign]] regarding his preferences with regard to judicial appointments.

From the beginning of her candidacy, Clinton stated that she would like to nominate justices who would overturn the decision in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'', a case allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns.<ref>Matea Gold and Anne Gearan, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/14/hillary-clintons-litmus-test-for-supreme-court-nominees-a-pledge-to-overturn-citizens-united/ Hillary Clinton’s litmus test for Supreme Court nominees: a pledge to overturn Citizens United]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (May 14, 2015).</ref>

On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated [[Merrick Garland]], Chief Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], to replace Scalia.<ref name="mshear">{{cite news|last1=Shear|first1=Michael D.|title=Obama Chooses Merrick Garland for Supreme Court|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/us/politics/obama-supreme-court-nominee.html|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=16 March 2016}}</ref> On February 23, 2016, the 11 Republican members of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] signed a letter to [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate majority leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] stating their intention to withhold consent on any nominee made by President Obama, and that no hearings would occur until after January 20, 2017, when the next president takes office.<ref>https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2719115/Senate-SCOTUS-Letter.pdf</ref> The 11 members are Committee Chair [[Chuck Grassley]], [[Iowa]];<ref name=GrassleyResponse>{{cite web | title = Grassley on Supreme Court Nomination: ‘We have a constitutional responsibility | url = http://whotv.com/2016/03/01/grassley-attends-white-house-meeting-for-supreme-court-nomination/ | publisher = [[WHO-DT|WHO tv]] interview | location = Des Moines, Iowa | date = March 1, 2016 | accessdate = March 3, 2016}}</ref> [[Orrin Hatch]] and [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]], [[Utah]]; [[Jeff Sessions]], [[Alabama]]; [[Lindsey Graham]], [[South Carolina]]; [[John Cornyn]] and [[Ted Cruz]], [[Texas]]; [[Jeff Flake]], [[Arizona]]; [[David Vitter]], [[Louisiana]]; [[David Perdue]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]; and [[Thom Tillis]], [[North Carolina]]. After Garland's nomination, Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] reiterated his position that the Senate would not confirm any Supreme Court nomination from Obama.<ref name="mshear"/> Garland's nomination is currently pending before the Senate.

Clinton has called on Congress to confirm Garland to the court during Obama's presidency,<ref name="Hill-7-30">Lydia Wheeler, "[http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/289643-clintons-court-shortlist-emerges Clinton's court shortlist emerges], ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' (July 30, 2016).</ref> and it has been speculated that the Senate may consider this nomination during the [[lame-duck session]] following the election. In the absence of such consideration, Clinton would begin his term with a vacancy to be filled on the Supreme Court. In addition, Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] (born 1933), [[Anthony Kennedy]] (born 1936) and [[Stephen Breyer]] (born 1938) are or will be over 80 years old during the president's first term of office, stoking speculation that additional appointments will be forthcoming.
