== Career ==

=== 2013 - 2015: early career and first releases ===
In 2013, Norton started to produce songs with [[Image-Line]]’s [[FL Studio]], and published tracks independently on his Soundcloud page.

During the summer of 2013, his track “Stranger” was released on [[Beatport]] and [[Spotify]], via Cue Digital Records<ref>{{Cite web|title = Stranger (Single) |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zsp6yglvjc |website = YouTube}}</ref> After this, Norton followed up with several bootlegs including [[Calvin Harris]]’s “Flashback” <ref>{{Cite web|title = Calvin Harris - Flashback (Owen Norton Remix) |url = http://www.yourmusicradar.com/calvin-harris-flashback-owen-norton-remix/|website = Your Music Radar}}</ref> and [[Ella Henderson]]’s “Ghost” <ref>{{Cite web|title = Ella Henderson - Ghost (Owen Norton Remix) | url = http://www.earbuddy.net/51332/ella-henderson-ghost-owen-norton-remix.html/|website = Earbuddy}}</ref>

In October 2014 Norton released a second original, this time a collaboration with Dutch DJ Flowmotion called "Ready" <ref>{{Cite web|title = Ready (Single) | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4pvzyXV_YU | website = YouTube}}</ref> and then subsequent single "Road To Nowhere" which was eventually uploaded to EDM.com's [[Soundcloud]] profile later that year.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Road To Nowhere (Single) |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zsp6yglvjc | website = YouTube}}</ref>

In 2015 he released a bootleg of [[Snow Patrol]]'s "Chasing Cars".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chasing Cars (Owen Norton & Sebastian Wibe Remix) |url = https://soundcloud.com/sebastian-wibe-bootlegs/chasing-cars | website = Soundcloud}}</ref> Dutch DJs [[Bassjackers]] closed their set at [[Tomorrowland]] with the bootleg,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bassjackers Live at Tomorrowland 2015 (Tracklist) |url = http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/82960_bassjackers-at-smash-the-house-stage-tomorrowland-belgium-2015-07-26.html | website = 1001tracklists}}</ref> and then [[Martin Garrix]] played it during some smaller club shows towards the end of the year.

Later in 2015 [[BBC Radio Leeds]] played his single "Wildfire"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wildfire (Single) | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXDtL-V-Y | website = YouTube}}</ref> on their [[BBC Introducing]] show.

Norton’s [[Soundcloud]] profile was terminated on the 14th of August, 2015 <ref>{{Cite web|title = Owen Tweeting about his Soundcloud’s termination | url = https://twitter.com/OwenNorton_/status/632192693347741697 | website = Twitter}}</ref> and his discography disappeared from music streaming services, including [[Spotify]], shortly afterwards.

=== 2016===
On February 19, Norton’s first release on his new [[Soundcloud]] profile and previously cleared [[Spotify]] tracklist was "Infinity”, a collaboration with personal friend Chasner.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Infinity - Single by Owen Norton & Chasner on iTunes|url = https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/infinity-single/id1084122774|website = iTunes}}</ref> Garrix played it in Mexico at [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] <ref>{{Cite web|title = Martin Garrix playing 'Infinity' at EDC Mexico 2016  |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frPlps1RhHU | website = YouTube}}</ref>

Shortly afterwards, Norton released "Liberté" <ref>{{Cite web|title = Liberté - Single by Owen Norton on iTunes|url = https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/liberte-single/id1099284223|website = iTunes}}</ref> - a track significantly different to his previous releases in both sound and style.
Later that month, Liberté was broadcast on [[Capital (radio network)]] and [[Radio 538]] on Garrix's radio show.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Martin Garrix Show 85|url = http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/104794_martin-garrix-the-martin-garrix-show-085-2016-04-22.html#tr_306603 | website = 1001tracklists}}</ref>

After being approached by [[Atlantic Records]], Norton went on to produce one of four official remixes of [[Flo Rida]]’s [[Hello Friday]] which was released on May 6, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hello Friday (remixes) on iTunes|url = https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/hello-friday-feat.-jason-derulo/id1109067667|website = iTunes}}</ref> The remix also premiered on EDM Youtube Channel "House Nation" <ref>{{Cite web|title = Hello Friday (Owen Norton Remix) | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgrfK7OxfHc | website = YouTube}}</ref> and has over 400,000 views as of June 2016.

Since release, the remix gathered radio support from [[Tiësto]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/108690_tiesto-olly-james-club-life-480-2016-06-10.html|title=Tiësto & Olly James - Club Life 480 2016-06-10 Tracklist / Playlist · 1001 Tracklists|last=1001Tracklists|website=www.1001tracklists.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref> [[Martin Garrix]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/106926_martin-garrix-the-martin-garrix-show-089-2016-05-20.html#tr_309162|title=Martin Garrix - The Martin Garrix Show 089 2016-05-20 Tracklist / Playlist · 1001 Tracklists|last=1001Tracklists|website=www.1001tracklists.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref> & [[Bassjackers]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/107427_bassjackers-jackindabass-radio-094-2016-05-27.html#tr_309162|title=Bassjackers - JackinDaBass Radio 094 2016-05-27 Tracklist / Playlist · 1001 Tracklists|last=1001Tracklists|website=www.1001tracklists.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref> all of which were broadcast on Dutch [[Radio 538]].
