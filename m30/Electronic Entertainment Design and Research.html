== Notable Research / Accomplishments ==

=== SMU/EEDAR Study ===

In 2010, [[SMU Guildhall]] and EEDAR teamed up to do a study measuring the impact of review scores and sales. The study split 165 participants who had never played [[Plants vs. Zombies]] into three groups: one who had been exposed to high review scores before playing, one who had been exposed to low review scores, and a control group who hadn’t been exposed to any.

On completing the study, the participants got a choice of taking the game or $10 in cash. Participants who were exposed to high review scores were twice as likely to take the game. Also, the participants who were shown higher review scores gave on average the game 20 points higher a review score than participants who were exposed to a low review score.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/06/eedar-smu-study-review-scores-affect-perceived-quality-purchas/|title= EEDAR/SMU study: review scores affect perceived quality, purchase intent|author=  Alexander Sliwinski|date= 7/6/2010|publisher= Joystiq|accessdate= 11/8/2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38121779/ns/technology_and_science-games/ |title=Video game reviews really do matter |author=Winda Benedetti |date= 2010-07-07|publisher= MSNBC|accessdate= 11/8/2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29309/Study_Review_Scores_Directly_Impact_Consumer_Purchasing_Opinion.php|title=Study: Review Scores Directly Impact Consumer Purchasing, Opinion  |author=Leigh Alexander |date=2010-07-07 |publisher= Gamasutra |accessdate=11/8/2010}}</ref>

=== Female Gamers ===

In 2010, EEDAR released a study about the gender of characters and how it affects the quality and sales of a game.
