The '''Page to Stage Festival''' is theatre festival established by John Mc, a Liverpool (UK) based writer, actor and businessman. It is a platform for emerging writers to stage their shows during a two week period in venues situated within Liverpool City Centre.

== Process ==
Scripts are submitted to the festival organisers, which are then passed to a panel of adjudicators who score and critique each play. From the submissions, the strongest plays are selected to be produced at the festival. 

Each writer acts as the executive producer for their own plays and, with the help of the festival organisers, select a director to work with them and then find a cast.

The festival organisers provide help and support throughout the process with a view to the writers developing the skills to enable them to self produce in the future.

== History ==
Early in January 2014, the director of a previously established festival posted on its website that he will no longer be holding the festival.

After much deliberation, John Mc decided that it was his duty to establish a festival that would fill the vacuum left by the announcement. He had the skills and the contacts to make it happen; he had been involved in the theatre festivals previously; he had experience of running other festivals, including the 0151 Film Festival in 2013.

His first task was to find a name for the festival. He polled his own twitter followers (@JohnMc_Lpool) and asked them to vote for their favourite name for the festival. More than fifty percent of those who responded selected “Page to Stage Festival” from a list of about ten suggestions.

On 15th January, the Facebook group (pagetostage) was launched, attracting over 500 members in the first week. This was followed with a twitter account (@P2S_Festival) and registered domain names including www.pagetostage.org.uk.

Thus was founded what it is hoped will be a successful annual festival that will eventually rival other such festivals in the UK.
