===Reviews===
MacKeeper has received mixed reviews with reviewers being very divided as to the effectiveness of the software. [[Macworld]] gave MacKeeper 3.5 out of 5 stars in August 2010, based on the 0.9.6 build of the program, and found it a reasonably priced set of tools but experienced lagging while switching between tools.<ref>{{cite web| title=MacKeeper 0.9.6 |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1151454/mackeeper.html |publisher=Macworld |first=Jeffery |last=Battersby |date=24 Aug 2010 }}</ref>  [[MacLife]] rated it at 2.5 out of 5 and said it to be useful mainly for freeing up drive space, but found other features offered inconsistent results and believed most users won’t need its antivirus feature.<ref>{{cite web| title=MacKeeper System Maintenance Suite Review |url=http://www.maclife.com/article/reviews/mackeeper_system_maintenance_suite_review |first=Adam |last=Berenstain |date=23 September 2011 |publisher=MacLife}}</ref> [[AV-Comparatives]] found that MacKeeper had an excellent ability to detect Mac-based [[malware]].<ref name="av-comparatives">{{cite web |url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mac_review_2013_en.pdf |title=Product Review: Mac Security - July 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=AV-Comparatives  |accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref> They noted that it was "very well suited to enthusiasts who have a good understanding of security issues, but not ideal for non-expert users who need pre-configured optimal security for their Macs."<ref name="av-comparatives">{{cite web |url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mac_review_2013_en.pdf |title=Product Review: Mac Security - July 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=AV-Comparatives  |accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref> [[OPSWAT]] awarded the program a Gold Certification for protecting users against antiphishing attempts as well as spyware and malware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb11043328.htm |publisher=PRWeb |title=MacKeeper is Awarded with a Gold Certification as a Security Software |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opswat.com/blog/february-certifications |publisher=OPSWAT |title=February Certifications |date=14 February 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>

===Criticism of marketing techniques===
Zeobit has been accused of employing misleading advertising with regard to its promotion of MacKeeper, including aggressive [[affiliate marketing]], [[pop-under ad]]s and planting [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet reviews]] as well as websites set up to discredit their competitors.<ref name="cultofmac"/><ref>{{cite web |title=MacKeeper, a rather slimy tale|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528010324/http://themacfeed.com/2011/06/mackeeper-a-rather-slimy-tale/}}</ref> ZeoBit claims that negative attacks were also launched against MacKeeper by an unnamed competitor, and that many users and press are confusing MacKeeper with another application.<ref>{{cite web|title=EXCLUSIVE: MacKeeper Says "Unethical Competitor Trying to Tarnish Our Reputation" |url=http://www.applegazette.com/feature/exclusive-mackeeper-says-unethical-competitor-trying-to-tarnish-our-reputation |publisher=Apple Gazette |first=Robin |last=Parrish |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref>

===Lawsuits===
{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}
In January 2014 a [[class action lawsuit]] was filed against Zeobit in [[Illinois]]. The lawsuit alleged that "neither the free trial nor the full registered versions of MacKeeper performed any credible diagnostic testing" and reported that a consumer's Mac was in need of repair and was at-risk due to harmful error.<ref name=CNSClass>{{cite news|title=Class Says 'MacKeeper; Software is Junkware.|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/01/21/64695.htm|agency=Courthouse News Service|date=January 21, 2014}}</ref> In May 2014 a lawsuit was filed against Kromtech in [[Pennsylvania]], alleging that MacKeeper fakes security problems to deceive victims into paying for unneeded fixes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lord|first=Rich|title=Pennsylvania woman sues company that promises computer security|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2014/05/06/Pennsylvania-woman-sues-company-that-promises-computer-security/stories/201405060191|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>

Kromtech has also filed lawsuits against those it perceives are [[defaming]] them. In July 2013 Kromtech filed a lawsuit against Macpaw, the developers of [[CleanMyMac]]. Kromtech alleged that Macpaw employees created several usernames and posts on several websites defaming the Mackeeper software.<ref>http://louisianarecord.com/news/254591-apple-anti-virus-software-creators-face-off-in-defamation-lawsuit</ref> In July 2014, MacKeeeper filed a lawsuit against David A. Cox alleging that he [[slander]]ed MacKeeper by calling it a fraudulent application in a [[YouTube]] video.<ref>http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/08/prweb12100581.htm</ref>
