'''Cantata++''', or simply ''Cantata'' in newer versions, is a proprietary [[computer program]] for [[software testing]] at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programs.

== Overview ==
Cantata belongs to a category of software tools which are used for [[dynamic testing]] of software. These tools bring [[Compiler|compiled]] [[test case]]s to execution with the [[Linker (computing)|linked]]-in code under test. The [[executable]] will run on a [[computing platform]], a [[Host (network)|host]], or a [[Cross compiler|target platform]]. Integration of [[debugger]]s is optional. 

Typical [[User (computing)|users]] are [[software developer|developer]]s of [[application software]] for general-purpose [[computer]]s, or of [[system software]] designed for [[embedded system]]s and [[mobile device]]s. Also, users of Cantata are often [[test design]]ers in the [[software development process]].

The [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] of Cantata is based on [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]. Furthermore, there is an Eclipse [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] available for development environments based on Eclipse, e.g. those of compiler vendors. Conversely, all plug-ins available for Eclipse can be installed in the Cantata IDE.

Because there is a command line present for Cantata it may fit well into [[test automation]] and [[continuous integration]] frameworks. 

'''Cantata''' is developed by the [[Concern (business)|concern]] '''QA Systems'''. QA Systems [[GmbH]] has acquired the product and retained its complete development staff from IPL Information Processing Ltd. in 2012, at the same time founding QA Systems Ltd. settled in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (UK).<ref>[//http://www.ipl.com/news/qa-systems-buys-cantata-business-from-ipl.html QA Systems buys Cantata++ from IPL] Website of IPL, called 4-27-14 </ref>

== Mode of operation ==
In Cantata the user creates a set of [[test case]]s for [[unit testing]], [[integration testing]], and [[code coverage]] for C and C++ [[Source code|code]].

The necessity of such testing arises from [[product liability]] according to the current state of technology. What the actual state of technology is, expresses itself in [[technical standard]]s, like [[IEC 61508]] and derivatives like [[ISO 26262]] or [[List_of_EN_standards#EN_50000.E2.80.93...|EN 50128]] ([[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|CENELEC]]). Therein [[requirement]]s can be found which relate to [[Functional Safety]] and how to ensure a certain [[Safety Integrity Level]] (SIL). 

Which [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] [[source code]] are to be tested with Cantata has to be decided by the user at the beginning of a test cycle. The user's decision depends on the maturity of the [[Modular programming|software modules]] of which the [[Interface (computing)|interfaces]] are as stable over time as possible. After selecting appropriate modules the user creates a discrete software test project that keeps its own lifecycle and maintenance parallel to the software development project. 

A copy of the modules' code (Software Under Test, SUT) will be filled and surrounded with further [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. This [[Instrumentation (computer programming)|instrumentation]] of a module is inevitable in order to put the SUT into a frame which is executable. This test frame is generated by Cantata and contains code which drives the test and the obligatory program [[entry point]] ([[main function|function <code>main()</code>]]) which regularly falls off when cutting the SUT.

Single [[subroutine|functions]] / [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] of the SUT will be executed with to-be-defined input values. The results will be compared with to-be-defined expected return values. Specification of the test cases like this is the task of test designers. It is carried out ad libitum, obeying a concerted [[test strategy]], or with the formal [[software requirements specification]] at hand.

Because there are calling dependencies between the SUT and untested modules within the software development project those other modules have to be eliminated from the software test project. So there is the need for substitutes which in a simple way pretend to do what the SUT actually expects. These substitutes are called [[Method stub|stubs]], [[test stub]]s, or [[Mock object|mocks]] and have the same [[Type signature|function signature]] as their originals.

The function bodies of stubs und mocks are created by Cantata, which is done selectively by means of the [[command-line interface]] or the IDE. The test designer is responsible for the simplifying [[implementation]] of the substitutes. If the user wishes he relies on a built-in [[Automatic programming|code generation]] mechanism which is a powerful help when testing [[legacy code]] of [[Reusability|re-usable]] [[Component-based software engineering|software components]].

There is an option in Cantata to instrument, log at runtime and check for [[code coverage]] regarding the [[control flow]]. This option works additionally as well as exclusively, i.e. without any test case specification. Test strategies caring for control flow are also relevant for [[Life-critical system|safety-critical systems]] with [[Safety Integrity Level|SIL]] >= 1. Result reports measure [[Statement_coverage#Basic_coverage_criteria|statement coverage]], [[Cyclomatic complexity|branch coverage]], [[modified condition/decision coverage]] and more.
