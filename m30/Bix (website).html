'''Bix''' was a web service best known for its online competitions. The site provided self-service tools for the creation of contests.  After a user created the contest, other members could enter and vote on the outcome of those contests.  The company was founded in February 2006 and received venture funding from Trinity Ventures and [[Sutter Hill Ventures]].

The website officially launched in July 2006<ref>{{cite web|title=Techcrunch covers Bix launch|url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/17/bix-sees-green-in-online-contests/|publisher=Techcrunch|accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref> with a web-based video recorder that merged a user's karaoke performance to create a contest entry.  The site received strong praise from industry experts including Walt Mossberg of the WSJ.<ref>{{cite web|title=WSJ Walt Mossberg reviews product|url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/16/yahoo-acquires-contest-site-bix/|publisher=WSJ|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref>  Within a few months the site opened up contests for audio karaoke, videos, photos and text.  In November 2006 the site switched to a [[faceoff style]] voting system, increasing votes from 5000 a day to 150,000 a day.  Site votes reached as much as 1,000,000 in a day in 2007.  Users voted 25 times per visit on average.

[[Yahoo!]] acquired Bix on November 16, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713214826/http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm|title=Yahoo!

Bix generated revenue by running contests for corporate clients.  Customers included [[Extra (TV series)]], [[Black Entertainment Television]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rapper The Game partners with Bix|url=http://www.hiphoppress.com/2006/10/hiphop_star_the.html|publisher=HipHopPress|accessdate=2006-10-17}}</ref> [[Capitol Records]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

Competitors included [[Singshot]] (discontinued) and [[Worth1000]].

Bix was also a [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] and website sponsored by [[Byte Magazine]] (BIX = "Byte Information Exchange"), rather like a [[social media]] site before such became popular.  The website survived for a short time after the magazine ceased publication in 2001 (there was a July issue, but no August issue that year).  The site had [[Internet forum|forums]] for virtually every known [[computer language]], most major computing topics of interest, and each forum was run by relatively well-known people in the industry.  The site was rather like a [[bulletin board system]], and by current standards was rather crude, but it was very popular at the time.

Bix was shut down by Yahoo June 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo Shuts Bix Down. Did Anyone Notice?|url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/04/yahoo-shut-bix-down-did-anyone-notice-when/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref>
