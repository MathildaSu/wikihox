==History==

Reddcoin was announced on January 20, 2014 as a [[Scrypt]] Proof of Work digital currency via an Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO).<ref name=TodaysCryptoCoin>{{cite web|title=Reddcoin|url=http://www.todayscryptocoin.com/reddcoin/|publisher=TodaysCryptoCoin|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=23 March 2014}}</ref> <ref name="Bitcointalk Announcement" />  The IPCO aimed to raise [[Bitcoin]] to fund the development of a new social-media-centric currency in the mold of Bitcoin and Litecoin.  With an originally intended cap of 109 billion Reddcoins eventually in circulation, Reddcoin was conceived to be a less expensive cryptocurrency to facilitate social media interactions between users around the world.<ref name="Emerging Coin" />   Over two stages, the IPCO successfully raised 168.83 Bitcoins (over $100,000 USD) from 386 investors in exchange for 5.45 billion Reddcoins to support the Reddcoin development team in creating, promoting, and building the Reddcoin brand and infrastructure.<ref name=IPCO>{{cite web|title=Reddcoin IPCO|url=http://www.reddcoin.com/ipo|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> <ref name="IPCO Results">{{cite web|title=IPCO Results|url=http://www.reddcoin.com/ipo-result|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> 

Originally launched with a logo featuring a red alien mascot on a gold coin, a design competition was held for a new community-chosen Reddcoin logo shortly after launch.<ref name="Reddcoin Design">{{cite web|title=Help Ricky Pr Choose a Design|url=https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/create-logo-reddcoin-cryptocurrency-seen-millions-286987/v2/poll/6t79p5?utm_source=voting_app&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=voting|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>   After three rounds of voting, the current logo was chosen by an overwhelming majority of voters.<ref name="Final Design">{{cite web|title=FINAL REDDCOIN LOGO DESIGN POLL!!!|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/1xq4t7/final_reddcoin_logo_design_poll/|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>   The new logo is designed to look like a coin jar (or [[piggy bank]]) with a red coin being placed in the jar as if being tipped.

Reddcoin experienced its first test of resilience on March 9, 2014 when a flaw in the source code governing the Reddcoin [[blockchain]] was exploited and the Reddcoin network was temporarily taken offline.

To date, Reddcoin continues to build interfaces with social media services.  Tipping platforms have been developed for Reddit, Twitter, Twitch.tv, and [[Justin.tv]].<ref name=Tipbots>{{cite web|title=Reddcoin Tip Bot Guides|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/wiki/index#wiki_reddcoin_tip_bot_guides|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>   Future plans call for further integration with additional social media services as Reddcoin continues to grow.

==The Social Currency==
[[File:TipReddcoinWeek Banner.jpg|500x270px|thumbnail|left|TipReddcoinWeek Banner]]

Reddcoin was conceived to be a digital currency aimed at bringing cryptocurrencies to mainstream social media and the general public.  While modeled after Bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies, Reddcoin’s focus was not immediately on an accumulation of wealth, but rather on achieving a wide distribution of Reddcoins across many social media platforms.<ref name="Reddit Wiki">{{cite web|title=/r/Reddcoin Wiki|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/wiki/index|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="Reddit FAQ" />    The concept called for Reddcoin to become the quintessential online tipping currency.  Reddcoin users have begun attempting to realize this mission through tipping campaigns on Twitter targeting journalists with backgrounds in cryptocurrencies and well as Bitcoin and [[Altcoin]] enthusiasts with large social media followings.<ref name="Rising Social Currency">{{cite news|last=Cordell|first=Drew|title=Reddcoin: The Rising Social Currency|url=http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/reddcoin-rising-social-currency/2014/03/21|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=Cryptocoins News|date=21 March 2014}}</ref> <ref name=TwitterCampaign>{{cite web|title=Today's 10 targets for Twitter Campaign|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/20w4rz/todays_10_targets_for_twitter_campaign_take_10/|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>   In addition, Reddcoin reddit users are known to tip Reddcoins in appreciation of posts and comments on both the Reddcoin community subreddit and other public subreddits.<ref name="Bitcoin Barbie RDD Intro">{{cite web|title=Introducing Reddcoin, a Social-Currency|url=http://bitcoinbarbie.com/introducing-reddcoin-a-social-currency/|publisher=BitcoinBarbie.Com|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>   Similarly, tipping campaigns have been conducted in appreciation of new content posted by users of Twitch.tv and Twitter. <ref name=#TipReddcoinWeek>{{cite web|title=#TipReddcoinWeek|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/24g6ic/upvote_buckle_up_tipreddcoinweek_is_launching_on/|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>  These tips are often the way that new users first become familiar with Reddcoin.

===Social Media Unit of Account===

As part of the whitepaper announcing the new Proof of Stake Velocity algorithm, Reddcoin lead developer Larry Ren (Reddit user /u/laudney) argued that a [[unit of account]] was needed for human social interactions.<ref name="PoSV Whitepaper" />   Ren specifically cited the many various forms of showing appreciation for user-generated content on social media, including Likes, Shares, Retweets, and Replies, as measurable yet incomparable yard sticks for comparing social interactions across social media platforms.<ref name="PoSV Whitepaper" />   Reddcoin, Ren stated, was created to fill this gap as a means of universally accounting for human social behaviors while adding a financial realization to these interactions.

===Reddcoin Broadcast===

As part of Reddcoin’s goal of entering mainstream social media, the Reddcoin development team introduced Reddcoin Broadcast on April 13,2014.<ref name="Reddcoin Launched Broadcast">{{cite news|last=Cordell|first=Drew|title=Reddcoin Launches Its Own Social Broadcast Platform|url=http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/reddcoin-launches-social-broadcast-platform/2014/04/13|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=Cryptocoins News|date=13 April 2014}}</ref> <ref name="Reddcoin Broadcast">{{cite web|title=REDDCOIN BROADCAST : Taking PR & Marketing To The Next Level.|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/22w2tg/major_announcement_reddcoin_broadcast_taking_pr/|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>   Reddcoin Broadcast is a Thunderclap-like platform for spreading messages across social media services including [[Facebook]], Twitter, and [[Tumblr]].<ref name="Reddcoin Launched Broadcast" />   Reddcoin users and community members can use Broadcast free-of-charge to expand the social media outreach of Reddcoin Developer-approved causes and solicit support for their causes from the Reddcoin community.

==Technical Information==

Launched February 2, 2014, Reddcoin was developed as a fork of the Litecoin open-source project, as utilized the same Scrypt Proof of Work algorithm for securing the Reddcoin blockchain and verifying Reddcoin transactions.<ref name="Reddit FAQ" /><ref name="Rising Social Currency" />    The blockchain has a block reward time of 60 seconds, compared with 10 minutes for the Bitcoin network and 2.5 minutes for Litecoin.<ref name="Crypto Frenzy">{{cite web|title=Reddcoin|url=http://cryptofrenzy.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/reddcoin/|publisher=Crypto Frenzy|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=5 March 2014}}</ref> <ref name="Reddit FAQ" />   This places Reddcoin’s block time on par with Dogecoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies.  After an initial bonus reward period, Reddcoin was designed to have a block reward of 100,000 Reddcoins for the first 500,000 blocks, or roughly 1 year.<ref name="Reddit FAQ" /><ref name="Cryptsy RDD Info">{{cite web|title=Reddcoin Information|url=https://www.cryptsy.com/currencies/view/126|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>    After this point, the reward would be cut in half for the next 500,000 blocks, and repeated after each subsequent 500,000 blocks.  This forms a geometrically decreasing series with a finite total number of Reddcoins of just over 100 billion coins.

It was announced on April 29, 2014 that Reddcoin would transition to an accelerated block schedule that would reduce the total number of mined Reddcoins to less than 30 billion Reddcoins.<ref name="PoSV Whitepaper" /> <ref name="PoSV FAQ" />   After this accelerated schedule, a new block reward system would be used in which the total number of Reddcoins in circulation would experience a permanent 5 percent annual inflation rate.<ref name="PoSV FAQ" />   As part of the announcement of the change, it was revealed that Reddcoin would transition to a new algorithm Proof of Stake Velocity sometime after three to six halvings.<ref name="PoSV Announcement" />   This places the date of the transition to PoSV between August 23, 2014 and December 8, 2014.  This loose timeline allows the Reddcoin development team time to implement all changes required to smoothly transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake Velocity.<ref name="PoSV Announcement" />   Additionally, the Reddcoin development team has pledged to use this time to allow the newly created PoSV algorithm to be vetted by the public as part of the open-source nature of the Reddcoin project.

==Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO)==

When Reddcoin was first introduced, the development team introduced an Initial Public Coin Offering of 5.45 billion Reddcoins in exchange for Bitcoin from interested investors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reddcoin Crypto-Currency Released Investment Period Ending On Feb 15th  Read more: http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1715179#ixzz30tu0IjyO|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1715179|publisher=DigitalJournal.Com|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=3 Feb 2014}}</ref> <ref name=IPCO /> <ref name="IPCO Results" />   This money raised would be used to support in the development, publicity, and support of Reddcoin during and after launch.<ref name=IPCO />   Over the following weeks, 168.8347 Bitcoin was raised, or over $100,000 USD.<ref name="Crypto Frenzy" /> <ref name="IPCO Results" />   To prevent a large influx of Reddcoin to the trading markets after launch, the 5.45 billion Reddcoins were distributed to the 386 investors over a 90 day time span at 1.11% of the total to be received distributed to each investor each day, ending in mid-May 2014.<ref name=IPCO />   The distribution of these 5.45 billion Reddcoins was distributed among investors in a tangentially increasing investment distribution to encourage larger investments.

During the first half of 2014, the development of [[Application-Specific Integrated Circuit]] (ASIC) hardware for use in Scrypt mining led to an increasing arms race associated with Proof of Work mining.<ref name="Scrypt Race Intensifies">{{cite web|last=Hajdarbegovic|first=Nermin|title=Scrypt ASIC Race Intensifies, KnCMiner Scores $2m in Preorders|url=http://www.coindesk.com/scrypt-asic-race-intensifies-knc-scores-2m-preorders/|publisher=CoinDesk.Com|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> <ref name="Future of Scrypt">{{cite web|title=Future of Scrypt - GPU and ASIC|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoinmining/comments/21o422/future_of_scrypt_gpu_and_asic/|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>   As a new coin still in its infancy, such developments could have resulted in a large centralization of mining power and prevented Reddcoin from reaching the widespread distribution necessary to achieve its goal of integration into social media.  In response, Reddcoin lead developer Larry Ren announced the development of a new network algorithm Proof of Stake Velocity.<ref name="PoSV Whitepaper" /> <ref name="PoSV Announcement" />   Modeled after Proof of Stake as introduced by Peercoin, Proof of Stake Velocity awards new block rewards based on coin age and coin velocity.<ref name="PoSV Whitepaper" />   Like with Peercoin, coin age rewards holders of Reddcoin with a certain proportional share of newly generated Reddcoins with each block.  Coin velocity introduces a new reward system complementing coin age by rewarding activity in the Reddcoin economy.<ref name="PoSV Whitepaper" /> <ref name="PoSV FAQ" />   This activity includes both peer-to-peer transactions and maintaining the Reddcoin network by keeping a Reddcoin wallet online to aid in verification of transactions.  Combined, block rewards for coin age and coin velocity are generated via a process known as [[Mint (coin)|minting]].  Reddcoin will utilize a 5% annual inflation model in implementing Proof of Stake Velocity.

==Reddcoin Exchanges==

In addition to receiving Reddcoin via social media tipping or by mining, Reddcoin can also be obtained through a number of online exchanges.<ref name="Get Reddcoin">{{cite web|title=How Can I get Reddcoin?|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/wiki/faq#wiki_.287.29_how_can_i_get_reddcoins.3F|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>   Typically, users must exchange Bitcoin for Reddcoin, though some exchanges such as Prelude by Moolah offer exchanges of [[fiat currency]] (such as US Dollar) for Reddcoin as well.  The largest exchange by daily volume has traditionally been Cryptsy, though other exchanges also share sizable trade volume.<ref name=Cryptsy>{{cite web|title=Cryptsy Market:RDD/BTC|url=https://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/169|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>
