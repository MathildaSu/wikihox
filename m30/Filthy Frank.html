'''TVFilthyFrank''' (sometimes shortened to simply '''Filthy Frank''') is a [[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] [[black comedy]] [[YouTube]] channel created and produced by college student '''George "Joji" Miller'''. Videos featuring the Filthy Frank character were first uploaded to Miller's original channel '''DizastaMusic''' starting in 2011 before moving to their current channel in 2013. The original Filthy Frank video entitled "Filthy Shit"<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH9JfE6Kq7Q|title=Filthy Shit|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref> has since spawned a full-fledged series with a colorful cast of characters and a deep-rooted mythology. The Filthy Frank series of videos have a devoted cult following and has helped the TVFilthyFrank YouTube channel gain over 2.5 million subscribers and 280 million overall views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://socialblade.com/youtube/usertvfilthyfrank|title=TVFilthyFrank Dailymotion Stats, Channel Statistics - Socialblade.com|website=socialblade.com|access-date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>

==Background==
The channel's content usually includes comedic skits with themes of [[racism]], [[misogyny]], [[Cruelty to animals|animal abuse]] and other offensive material. The channel produces a multitude of different videos, ranging from angry and vengeful satirical rants,<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPr1W_EXftA|title=I HATE HIGH SCHOOL|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref> music videos featuring Frank's friend Pink Guy,<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dbR2JZmlWo|title=PINK GUY - KILL YOURSELF|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref> Q&As,<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSQyhZ207YA|title=ASK FILTHY FRANK #4 (KILLING BABIES & POWER RANGERS)|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref> and collaborative videos featuring other [[YouTube]]rs.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x71MDrC400A|title=Deadly Twister - (Feat. Idubbbz & FilthyFrank)|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=maxmoefoe}}</ref> Some videos are story-fledged, with the scientific structures "[[chromosomes]]" being one of the channel's major plot elements, depicted as a power source, currency, and an unit of time. All characters use chromosomes for their personal deeds throughout the channel's videos.

According to the channel's description, the offensive nature of its content is intended to parody social media and how it reflects human nature, stating that "Filthy Frank is the embodiment of everything a person should not be. He is anti-PC, anti-social, and anti-couth. He behaves and reacts excessively to everything expressly to highlight the ridiculousness of racism, misogyny, legalism, injustice, ignorance and other social blights. He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive. Yes, there is no denying that the show is terribly offensive, but this terrible offensiveness is a deliberate and unapologetic parody of the whole social media machine and a reflection of the human microcosm that that social media is."<ref>https://www.youtube.com/user/TVFilthyFrank/about</ref>

==Characters==
* '''Filthy Frank (also referenced to as Papa Franku or Francis of the Filth)''' - The titular character and main protagonist. He is an unhygienic, vulgar, middle-aged man who speaks with a raspy, scratchy voice, who continually breaks social norms and rants about contemporary problems (typically minor ones). He has been dubbed the "Ed Wood of YouTube".
* '''Pink Guy (originally called Mr. Pink)''' - A man wearing a pink Lycra suit and Frank's best friend. Usually speaks gibberish but occasionally speaks, sings, or raps in coherent English. He is also known to write and produce music: he is even credited with nearly all the original music from the show.<ref>http://pinkguy.bandcamp.com/album/pink-guy. This album is a near comprehensive list of the original songs included on the show from its inception to mid-2014.</ref>
* '''Salamander Man''' - An [[anthropomorphic]] [[salamander]] known in Filthy Frank lore for his "ass flute", his infamous habit of rubbing his nipples, and his signature catchphrase, "Nyess!" Much like Pink Guy, he occasionally takes to the streets to harass pedestrians. 
* '''Dr. Trill''' - A man wearing a white Lycra suit and Filthy Frank's son. Is shown to have much distain for his father in the video "NOISE COMPLAINTS", where he screams "I never loved you, Dad!" at Frank.
* '''Safari Man''' - One of Frank's many roommates. A stereotypical [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourist.
* '''Santa's Brother''' - Also known as Carlos "Nathan Jingle Claus" Gonzales, he is a perverted, scantily clad man dressed in attire not entirely unlike Santa Claus. He apparently has "polio", a brain tumor responsible for his personality, and insists that he's shot various people, usually in the kneecaps. 
* '''Red Dick''' - A man in a red suit with a deadpan expression. He is a gourmet chef and a friend of Pink Guy.
* '''maxmoefoe (aka Maxy Boy)''' - An [[Australian]] YouTuber and Frank's protégé. A dedicated chef, he is known for assisting Frank with his culinary creations: the hair and vomit cakes.

The character is known to have [[42 (number)|forty two]] [[SoundCloud]] followers and has also released a single titled "Hand On My Gat" in which he raps and displays his individuality, spirituality, and miraculous powers.
* '''Mr. Negi''' - A mute man dressed in a brown Lycra suit. "Negi" means "[[Leek]]" or "[[Scallion|Spring onion]]" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which is appropriate as Mr. Negi is very fond of leeks.  
* '''Lemon''' - A mentally disabled man with a lemon for a head.

After returning to Earth in search of a "good time", he meets up with and serves as a bad influence to Frank. The two would engage in heavy drug use, unprotected sexual acts, and serve as the heads of an intergalactic drug ring until the alien's untimely demise. 
* '''Chin Chin (aka the Dark Lord)''' - The main antagonist and one of the strongest entities in the Filthy Frank universe. He annually demands sacrifices from Frank, which Frank gathers from his fans in the form of videos of their sacrifice rituals. 
* '''Negative Chin Chin''' - Somewhat of a "[[Bizarro World|bizarro world]]" version of Chin Chin, he is a grotesque Australian dark lord, who first appeared in maxmoefoe's 2015 sacrifice to Chin Chin. Known for wearing a white Lycra suit and a [[fedora]].  
* '''Plastic Pinocchio''' - One of Chin Chin's minions.
* '''Brock Lee''' - One of Frank's henchmen. He is an illegal crawfish racer who wields weaponized broccoli nunchucks. 
* '''Dr. Sack''' - An infamous doctor who despises Frank and his antics.

* '''The Shaman (aka Alpha Centurion)''' - One of Frank's friends. He has [[dwarfism]] and defined muscles. He is a healer and sometimes acts as the voice of reason. For example, he condemns Frank after he realizes Frank collected dead rats from the streets of New York City and planned to feed them to him.

==History==
Miller's Filthy Frank character can be traced back to 2011 when videos featuring the character began being uploaded to the DizastaMusic YouTube channel. The channel had been previously used by Miller to upload videos featuring him and his friends, such as the fledging TEMPURA BOYZ series.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0TSnKt4QSQ|title=TEMPURA BOYZ bloopers (Be sure to watch episode 1)|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref>

In January 2013, the DizastaMusic channel uploaded a video entitled "FILTHY COMPILATION #6 - SMELL MY FINGERS",<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeO3yCpLt0Q|title=FILTHY COMPILATION #6 - SMELL MY FINGERS |date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref> this video compilation helped create the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]] [[Internet meme]].<ref>{{cite news |author = Andy Beta |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/baauer-is-shaking-off-the-blessing-and-curse-of-meme-stardom-20160217?page=2 |title= Baauer Is Shaking Off the Blessing and Curse of Meme Stardom |quote = Just getting the smallest little touch of that experience was too much for me |date = February 17, 2016 |work = [[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate = June 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/02/15/fader-explains-harlem-shake/|title=FADER Explains: Harlem Shake|last=Zeichner|website=FADER|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21624109|title=Harlem Shake: Tracking a meme over a month|last=Magazine|first=Tom Heyden BBC News|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-06-27}}</ref>

Starting in early 2014, new Filthy Frank content began being uploaded on the TVFilthyFrank channel and the DizastaMusic channel was slowly phased out. The move was completed on August 15, 2014.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfcvIA366A|title=NEW CHANNEL: TVFILTHYFRANK|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref> A final video was uploaded to DizastaMusic on March 8, 2015.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juk0QrWBglo|title=kill me! haha!|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref>

Since their initial appearances in 2011, Filthy Frank and his supporting cast of characters have became very popular despite their politically incorrect nature. Various Filthy Frank merchandise has been made, including a free Pink Guy album released in 2014.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVyFy61SP4U|title=PINK GUY (FULL ALBUM)|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 16, 2016|people=Filthy Frank}}</ref> That same year Miller launched the TooDamnFilthy channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TooDamnFilthy|title=TooDamn Filthy Channel|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=April 5, 2016}}</ref> This serves as the new 2nd channel for the Filthy Frank videos and features its own original content.

Starting in 2015, the channel began collaborating with fellow YouTubers iDubbbzTV, [[HowToBasic]], and maxmoefoe. Since the initial collaborations, Filthy Frank and Pink Guy have since appeared in videos made by [[JonTron]]<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsWlKOwqlD4|title=The Skateboard Kid|date=June 7, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 11, 2016|people=Jon Tron}}</ref> and [[h3h3 Productions]].<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuFhH98DOwc|title=Ravioli Hungry Gold Digger Prank!!|date=June 7, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=June 11, 2016|people=h3h3 Productions}}</ref>

Miller produces most of the music for his show, normally credited as "Pink Guy", however he has also produced a few songs as "Politikz", satirising internet rappers. He released an eponymous album for free on [[Bandcamp]] and Youtube named "Pink Guy", in which he raps as several characters, including Salamander Man, Santa's Brother, Pink Guy and Filthy Frank himself. A second album, "Pink Season" has been teased on the video "FILTHY FRANK VS ANIMAL RIGHTS". <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAPMZpaJRg0</ref> Miller also releases music under the name "Joji".
