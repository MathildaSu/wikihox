'''''Carnaby Street''''', is a radio programme broadcast on [[Manx Radio]] on Saturday mornings and features music from the 1960s. <ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.manxradio.com/on-air/carnaby-street/carnaby-street/</ref> It is presented by Chris Williams and features music and news from two chosen years. The programme is produced by Blackpool Bullet Productions for Chris Williams Entertainments<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and is sponsored by the [[Isle of Man Transport|Isle of Man Railways]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The show is broadcast across the [[Isle of Man]], [[North West England]], [[North Wales]], Southern Scotland and northern parts of Ireland on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[Medium wave|MW]] frequencies as well as world wide through the [[Manx Radio]] website.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> 

The title of the show is taken from [[Carnaby Street]], seen by many as the epi-centre of [[Swinging London]] in the 1960s.

The show commences at the conclusion of the 08:30am news bulletin and begins with Williams playing the show's theme tune, ''Crunchy Granola Suite'' by [[Percy Faith|Percy Faith & His Orchestra.]]<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Williams then gives a brief outline of the chosen years of that week's show, together with the artists which will be featured, and concludes his introduction with the phrase; ''"Let's get on with it!"''<ref name="ReferenceB">http://www.manxradio.com/radioplayer/od/1393/</ref>

==Show format==
The format takes the form of a contemporary presentation in two chosen years.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Williams, with the assistance of his ''"co-presenters" Doris the Tea Lady, Harry the Engine Driver and Roger the Fireman,'' take the listener onboard the [[Isle of Man Transport|Isle of Man Railways]] time train, whereupon they are transported back to the chosen year.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Williams then presents music from the particular year as well as contemporary news items which are spoken about in the context of the [[Present tense|present tense]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The show leans heavily on the style of presentation from [[Radio Caroline]], using radio jingles and competitions which would of been familiar to listeners of [[Radio Caroline]] in the 1960s.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/> If the chosen year is pre-1964, jingles from [[Radio Luxembourg]] are used instead.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Numerous competitions from the programme's sponsors are also featured with various prizes offered.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The music is by various well-known 60s artists, and the playlist also includes three million selling records from both of the featured years.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The style of presentation of the show is exceedingly upbeat and positive, being referred to by Williams as: ''"the best little 60's show on the radio."''<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Often heard are quips by ''Doris'', which invariably take the form of [[Double entendre|''double entendre.'']]<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The show generally ends with Williams reviewing some aspects of the show whilst ''Crunchy Granola Suite'' plays in the background.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The edition is then available on the [[Manx Radio|Manx Radio website]] to be listened to again for the following seven days.

Whilst [[Manx Radio]] is a commercial radio station, advertising content on the show is for the show's sponsor only. However, contemporary radio adverts are also played in order to re-create the flavour of radio broadcasting in the 1960s.

==History==
The programme can trace its lineage from previous [[Manx Radio]] programmes of a similar genre such as ''The Golden Oldies Show'' which was presented by Stu Lowe.<ref>http://www.manxradio.com/</ref> Following Lowe's departure from [[Manx Radio]], Andy Wint took over the presentation and set about enhancing the presentation style and the show's format, providing a more professional tone to the production. This has been further enhanced by Williams resulting in the show's current format.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Guest presenters==
In May 2015 Chris Williams had to temporarily stand down from presenting ''Carnaby Street'' following a bout of illness, with Simon Clarke deputising. Following recuperation Williams returned to present the show on the 27th June.
