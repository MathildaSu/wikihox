In 1982, Jean, the wife of a minister, Dr. Lincoln Griswold, learned that a woman in her husband’s [[Church body|church]] had died because the woman was unable to find anyone to care for her. She stopped eating and drinking and died of [[kidney failure]]. The Griswolds realized this death could have been prevented if help had been available. Jean, a former [[geriatric]] counselor, with a [[master's degree]] in [[education]], had a deep compassion for people with physical difficulties since she had been living with [[Multiple Sclerosis]] since 1969. Griswold Home Care (see also [[home care]])was Jean’s calling in life. On September 27, 1997,First Lady [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] wrote to Dr. Griswold from the [[White House]]: ''I commend you for your efforts to alleviate the suffering of others and to improve the quality of life for the people in communities throughout the Northeast''. The company was the first to offer 24 hour service at affordable prices.  In 1985 Jean’s husband joined his wife at GSC. On August 20, 1997 Tipper Gore wrote to Dr. Griswold from the Office Of The [[Vice President of the United States]]: ''Your entrepreneurship and ingenuity have enabled individuals with illnesses to have the opportunity to receive the care they deserve''. Jean and Lincoln's founding vision are still actively engaged throughout the company.

In 2013, GHC celebrates its 31st anniversary, the company has approximately 240 territories in 33 U.S. states. In the three decades since the company’s inception, Griswold Home Care has helped more than 80,000 individuals and families throughout the United States, referring more than 9,000 caregivers in any given year.
