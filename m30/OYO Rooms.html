==Business Model==
OYO Rooms is an online aggregator of budget hotels. OYO Rooms partners with hotels with the aim of standardization on various measures in each room including free wifi and breakfast, flatscreen TVs, spotless white bed linen of a certain thread count, branded toiletries, 6-inch shower heads, a beverage tray and so on. The standards are audited every few days so that the customers are assured a quality experience. OYO’s budget stays range from 999 ($16) to 4,000 rupees ($66). OYO provides property owners with support such as quality standardized supplies and service training. OYO boasts of a 24x7 in-house customer service center. However recently OYO has changed its policy and allow you to spend only 25% of  referral money when you book a hotel, the rest must be paid by the guest from his pocket, a complete "U-turn" from their initial model.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Why A 21-Year-Old Is Building OYO As An Uber (And Not An Airbnb) For Hotels In India|url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/saritharai/2015/08/06/why-a-21-year-old-is-building-oyo-an-uber-and-not-an-airbnb-for-hotels-in-india/|accessdate = 2015-08-25|first = Saritha|last = Rai}}</ref>

==Founder==

He dropped out of college and launched his first start‐up Oravel Stays Pvt. Ltd. in the year 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ritesh Agarwal's journey from being a SIM-seller to the helm of OYO Rooms|url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-08-03/news/65165759_1_ritesh-agarwal-thiel-fellowship-oyo-rooms|accessdate = 2015-08-25}}</ref> Oravel was designed  as  a  platform to  enable  listing  and  booking  of  budget  accommodation. Being an avid traveler, he soon realized that the budget hospitality sector lacked predictability. Therefore, he pivoted Oravel to OYO  Rooms  in  2013  with  the  key  proposition  of  offering  affordable  and  standardized accommodation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = At 21, He's the Mind Behind Multi-Million Dollar Start-Up OYO|url = http://www.ndtv.com/people/at-21-hes-the-mind-behind-multi-million-dollar-start-up-oyo-1204353|accessdate = 2015-08-25}}</ref>
