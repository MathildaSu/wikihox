== Biography ==
Oesch was born in [[Harrisonville, Missouri]] September 19, 1950 into a family of builders.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sustainable Architect Fred Oesch builds a bar in the tasting room| url=http://www.scottsvilleweekly.com/issue111.html|work=Scottsville Weekly|first=Bebe|last=Williams|issue=111|date=10 August 2012}}</ref> Drawn to [[Design-build]] and Art at an early age, Oesch designed and built custom furniture while attending several universities including [[Marlboro College]], [[Kansas City Art Institute]], and [[University of New Mexico]]. Oesch received his Bachelor of Arts from [[Mary Baldwin University]] in 1992, and his Master of Architecture from [[Virginia Tech]] in 1997.

As an early proponent and pioneer of [[Green building]]. In 1975 Oesch co-founded Middle River Mill Co. in [[Machias, Maine]], a [[Design-build]] firm specializing in custom furniture and [[Passive solar building]] design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo-zmf4p3JM|title=Fred Oesch – Designing and Building in Response to Climate Change|first=|last=The Oracle Institute|date=27 July 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 1988 Oesch opened and curated Gallery NEO in Charlottesville, Virginia from which he founded his [[Environmental Design]] practice. In 1997, Oesch moved his office to his home in Schuyler, Virginia and started his company, Oesch Environmental Design, to offer integrated state-of-the-art sustainable design and construction management services. Every design is unique with respect to his client's program, aesthetic style preferences, site, and budget,<ref>http://caribbeanhomeandhouse.com/directory/oesch-environmental-design</ref> while the common assets of every project includes energy efficiency, healthful materials and systems, and, most importantly, affordability. Operating as a sole proprietor guarantees that all aspects of every project receive optimal attention to every detail, from concept to occupancy.

Oesch is known for his [[Sustainable design]] work including land planning, custom homes, interiors, furniture, and fine art.<ref>https://vimeo.com/39307387</ref> Oesch's projects feature [[Solar architecture]] and the [[Efficient energy use]] of alternative materials and building systems including [[Green roof]], [[Earth house]], and [[Straw-bale construction]].

Today, there are few environmental designers who have the extensive experience, visionary ideals, and actual built examples of residential green design and building than Oesch,<ref>http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/ans/HTMView.asp?parItem=S031000049A</ref> whose reputation is well established, with a proven history of delivering healthful state-of-the-art homes for environmentally conscious clients.<ref>http://www.fredoesch.com/video.html</ref> Far more than energy efficient houses, Oesch's dwellings are healthful living environments that directly affect the health, well-being, and spirit of the occupants.<ref>http://pmhatwater.hypermart.net/Shop/market/files/d1e72940fa78274590e7f214be141ecd-61.html</ref>

# Utilization of Indigenous Technology, Materials, and Labor Skills
# Direct Response to Microclimate / Seamless Site Integration
# Minimum Inventory / Maximum Diversity Systems
# Direct Designer / Builder / Inhabitant Participation
# Net Resource and Energy Production
# Self-Regenerating 'Living' Systems
