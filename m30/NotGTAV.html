'''''NotGTAV''''' is a 2015 [[Casual game|casual]] [[video game]] developed and published by British game developer group, NotGames LLP, who are donating all profits from the title to local charity [[Peer Productions]]. It is currently the lead game in NotGames series. The game was released on July 2, 2015, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]] (available via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]) with the price $2.99.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/369580/|title=NotGTAV on Steam|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> The game was also released on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] via [[Google Play]] and [[iOS]] via [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NotGames.NotGTAV|title=NotGTAV on Play Store|publisher=Google|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/notgtav/id903354679?mt=8|title=NotGTAV on AppStore|publisher=Apple|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
NotGames LLP describes ''NotGTAV'' as a 'ruthless Snake-like parody' of [[Rockstar Games]]' hit, [[Grand Theft Auto V]], but set in various locations in [[England]]. The [[snake game]] style is used as reductionist satire of the original GTA title, whilst the characters and voice acting satirise the locations and characters in Britain.

===Plot and mission===
In-game, the player is given missions to complete, like the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto series]] with repeated mechanics of hitting targets and completing heists.
