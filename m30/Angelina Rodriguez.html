'''Angelina Rodriguez''' is an [[United States|American]] woman from [[Montebello, California]] who was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] for the September 2000 murder of her fourth husband, Frank Rodriguez. She was also accused of killing her infant daughter in 1993 by [[suffocation|suffocating]] her with a [[pacifier]]. Angelina is currently incarcerated at the [[Central California Women's Facility]] in [[Chowchilla, California]], where she is on [[death row]] awaiting execution.<ref name="Fatal Lies">{{cite news|author=Gina Piccalo|title=Fatal Lies|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2005-03-09|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/09/entertainment/et-angelina9}}</ref>

==Background==
Angelina Rodriguez met her husband Frank, a [[special education]] teacher, while working at a camp in [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. The couple married in April 2000.<ref name="Jury Calls">{{cite news|author=Anna Gorman|title=Jury Calls for Poisoner's Death|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2003-11-13|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/13/local/me-death13}}</ref> It was Angelina's fourth marriage.<ref name="Fatal Lies"/> Prosecutors argue that within months of the marriage, Angelina took out a $250,000 [[life insurance]] policy on Frank and began plotting to kill him. She was suspected of poisoning Frank's tea with [[oleander]] leaves, loosening the gas cap on their clothes dryer, and finally adulterating her husband's [[Gatorade]] with [[antifreeze]]. Frank Rodriguez died on September 9, 2000. His death was initially ruled undetermined, but the lack of a [[cause of death]] meant that Angelina could not get a [[death certificate]] or Frank's life insurance. She pushed for more testing, and those results showed that he had been intentionally poisoned. Angelina was arrested for murder in [[Paso Robles, California]] in February 2001.<ref name="Greed">{{cite news|author=Frank C. Girardot|title=How greed kept one woman from getting away with her husbandâ€™s murder|publisher=[[Pasadena Star-News]]|date=2015-01-23|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/general-news/20150123/how-greed-kept-one-woman-from-getting-away-with-her-husbands-murder}}</ref>

==Trial==
Three years after Frank's death, Angelina's murder [[trial]] began in the fall of 2003. During the years since her arrest, prosecutors discovered that her 13-month-old daughter Alicia died suspiciously in 1993. Angelina claimed that her daughter choked on a pacifier that became dislodged, but evidence proved that Angelina removed the pacifier and used it to suffocate Alicia. Angelina then sued the pacifier manufacturer and was awarded a [[settlement]] of $710,000. She also received a $50,000 life insurance policy after Alicia's death was ruled accidental. Though she was never charged with a crime for her daughter's death, this evidence was presented at her trial to show that Angelina's motive for murder was financial.<ref name="Sentence">{{cite news|author=Anna Gorman|title=Wife Gets Death for Killing Husband|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2004-01-13|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/13/local/me-poison13}}</ref>

Angelina Rodriguez was [[conviction|convicted]] of [[first-degree murder]] in October 2003, with the special circumstances of financial gain and poisoning. The following month, the jury recommended a death verdict.<ref name="Jury Calls"/> Angelina was formally sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]] in January 2004. In his sentencing, [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] Judge William R. Pounders stated that she killed her husband in an "exceptionally cruel and callous" way and that her guilt had been proved to "an absolute certainty... In the past 20 years, I have never seen a colder heart." Despite her conviction and death sentence, Angelina argued her innocence, and maintained that her husband's death was a [[suicide]] by antifreeze poisoning.<ref name="Sentence"/>

==Aftermath==
Angelina Rodriguez was awarded a new sentencing hearing in 2010, but was re-sentenced to death in November 2010. Her most recent appeal was denied by the [[California Supreme Court]] in February 2014.<ref name="Appeal">{{cite news|author=Maura Dolan|title=Death sentence upheld for Montebello woman who murdered her husband|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2014-02-20|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/20/local/la-me-ln-court-murder-20140220}}</ref> Angelina remains on death row at the [[Central California Women's Facility]] in [[Chowchilla, California]]. However, she is planning to appeal her case to the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref name="Christian Post">{{cite news|author=Sami K.
