'''Civitatis International''' is a private foundation that promotes peace, dialogue and cooperation between nations and civilizations. Civitatis International convenes policy seminars for the Ambassadors to the Court of St. James's and advises stakeholders around the world.

The institute was heavily criticised in early 2015 for having charged unpaid interns £300 in return for work references.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/10/thinktank-interns-charged-300-pounds-job-reference|title=Unpaid interns charged £300 for a job reference by thinktank|author=Daniel Boffey|work=the Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://graduatefog.co.uk/2015/3821/job-reference-fee-graduate-intern-civitatis-jan-mortier/
