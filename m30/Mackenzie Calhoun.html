'''Mackenzie Calhoun''' (born '''M'k'n'zy of Calhoun''') is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]]. Created by [[Peter David]], Calhoun is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] from the planet Xenex, and is [[Captain (Star Trek)|captain]] of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] ''[[List of Star Trek ships|USS Excalibur]]''.

Calhoun appears primarily in ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'', a series of [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] novels and [[comic books]] set during the [[Timeline of Star Trek|24th century]] era of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', in which he is the main character. He first appeared in the 1997 ''New Frontier'' [[debut novel]], ''Star Trek: New Frontier: House of Cards''.

Calhoun is the only ''Star Trek'' character that has not appeared in any of the ''Star Trek'' [[television series]] or [[movies]] to have an [[action figure]].

==Fictional character history==
Calhoun is born M'k'n'zy of Calhoun on the planet [[Xenex]], in the city of Calhoun. He grows up under the brutal rule of the Danteri, who occupied his world. As a child, M'k'n'zy witnesses the public execution of his father in a town square by Falkar of Danter, which spurs him to grow into a rebel warlord.<ref name="HouseOfCards">Peter David. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: House of Cards''; 1997</ref> He kills his first person at age 14, and is given command of a strike vessel that marked the beginning of the Xenexian rebellion.<ref name="Burned">Peter David. ''Star Trek New Frontier: The Captain's Table, Book 5: Once Burned''</ref> By the time M'k'n'zy is 20, he  liberates Xenex.<ref name="HouseOfCards"/> Shortly after doing so, he fathers a son, Xyon, with Catrine, a woman from the Calhoun clan whose husband had died, as she requests as part of Xenexian culture.<ref>Peter David. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Martyr''</ref>

Calhoun encounters [[Jean-Luc Picard]], who, while commanding the [[USS Stargazer|USS ''Stargazer'']], visits Xenex as a representative of the [[United Federation of Planets]] to assist in negotiations between Xenex and Danter. Picard convinced Calhoun to join [[Starfleet]], the scientific and defensive arm of the Federation.<ref name="HouseOfCards"/> Calhoun leaves Xenex, a move which rouses the ire of many of his people, to enter [[Starfleet Academy]], where he meets [[List of Star Trek characters (N–S)#Shelby|Elizabeth Shelby]], who would become his lover, rival and, eventually, fiancée. Their engagement ends after Calhoun took the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' test.<ref>Peter David. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Stone and Anvil''</ref>

As a Starfleet officer, Calhoun served aboard the USS ''Grissom'',<ref name="HouseOfCards"/> where he meets Katarina "Kat" Mueller, who would become his lover.<ref name="Burned"/> It was on the ''Grissom'' that he learns to play [[poker]], and establishes a reputation for being able to bluff his way through any hand, even evading an [[empath]]'s attempt to get a bead on him.<ref name="Void">Peter David. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Into the Void''</ref> Calhoun was present during a catastrophic event aboard the ''Grissom'', which led to his apparent departure from Starfleet.<ref name="Burned"/> In reality, he becomes an undercover operative for head of Starfleet Intelligence Admiral Alynna Nechayev who, years afterward, fearing Calhoun was getting "too deep" into the lifestyle of the thugs and criminals he was associating with, pulled him out and gave him his own starship to command, the USS ''Excalibur''. It was in taking this command that he is reunited with both Shelby, who was now his First Officer,<ref name="HouseOfCards"/> and Mueller, whom he picked as his [[Executive Officer]] (the terms are normally synonymous on the various television series, but in the ''New Frontier'' novels, a First Officer heads the ship's day shift, while the Executive Officer commands the night shift watch).<ref name="Burned"/> Calhoun is assigned to Sector 221-G, the area of space of the former Thallonian Empire, which has collapsed, resulting in destabilization of the region.<ref name="HouseOfCards"/>

Calhoun makes an appearance in the 2007 ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' novel ''Before Dishonor'' by [[Peter David]]. In the novel, Calhoun encounters Picard en route to Sector 001 to defend [[Earth]] against a new [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] threat.

Calhoun's older brother, D’ndai, dies during an alien invasion of his homeworld, Xenex, in the 2011 novel ''Blind Man's Bluff''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Blind Man's Bluff|last= David|first= Peter|year= 2011|publisher= Simon and Schuster|ISBN= 978-1-4516-1169-4|page=}}</ref>

==Mirror Universe==
[[File:MirrorMacCrop.jpg|thumb|left|The Mirror Mac, from ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Turnaround'' #3 (April 2008); Page 22. Art by Stephen Thompson.]]
The [[Mirror Universe]] counterpart of Calhoun first appears in "Cutting Ties", a story in the 2007 [[anthology]] ''Star Trek Mirror Universe: Obsidian Alliances''. In the mirror universe, instead of witnessing his father's fatal beating at the hands of the Danteri, young M'k'n'zy begs for his father's life, insisting that he has no knowledge of D'ndai's rebellious activities. Humiliated by what he sees as his son's weakness, Gr'zy disowns the boy, who is treated as an outcast. When Praetor Hiren, the leader of the Danteri's allies, the Romulans, comes to Calhoun, he takes the boy, whom he renames "Muck", to live with him on Romulus, as assurance against further rebellion. The abusive Hiren gives Muck a scar on his face corresponding to the one possessed by Captain Calhoun in our universe. After a year in Hiren's residence, Hiren orders the boy to execute Gr'zy, who has continued his rebellion, but Gr'zy commits suicide before Muck can do this. The furious Hiren banishes Muck to the mines of Remus, where the young slave endures years of torment from other miners, until he kills his tormenters. He is eventually purchased by the Mirror Soleta and her father, Rojan, and becomes Soleta's lover. Muck and Soleta are present during a meeting arranged by Praetor Hiren between Rojan and the Mirror Lord Si Cwan of the Thallonian Empire and Falkar of Danter aboard Si Cwan's ship, the ''Stinger''. There, Muck meets the Mirror Kalinda, Burgoyne 182, Zak Kebron, Robin Lefler, and Elizabeth Shelby. Muck discovers that the Mirror Mark McHenry's god-like powers are used as the ship's intelligence and power source.  

Rojan is murdered on the orders of Hiren, along with Falkar and Shelby, enraging the heartbroken Muck. Si Cwan, Kebron, and Burgoyne are also killed, and Muck and Soleta take control of the ''Stinger'', with Muck intending to destroy the surface of Danter, Romulus, Xenex, and every planet he can find, arguing that the universe deserves to die. McHenry shows Muck the Mackenzie Calhoun of our universe, and the life he has led. Inspired by the possibilities he can fight for, Muck destroys only Danter's military infrastructure and uninhabited areas of its surface, liberating Xenex. Inspired by his counterpart, he takes the name "Mac", and begins his life anew as a freedom fighter.<ref name=Obsidian>Peter David. 2007; ''Star Trek: Mirror Universe: Obsidian Alliances''; "Cutting Ties"; Page 199</ref>

Mac and his crew next appear in the 2008 [[comic book]] miniseries ''Star Trek: New Frontier - Turnaround''. It is revealed that they embarked on a series of successful strikes against the Alliance, during which the mirror Edward Jellico joined Mac's crew. During one such engagement, Soleta is killed, and the ''Stinger'' finds itself transported through a portal in space into the prime universe. Mac's crew spends the next several weeks making allies,<ref name=Turnaround5>Peter David. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Turnaround'' #5; July 2008; [[IDW Publishing]]</ref> before stealing the ''Paradox'', an experimental [[time travel|timeship]] created by Starfleet and the [[Daystrom Institute]],<ref name=Turnaround1>Peter David. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Turnaround'' #1, March 2008, IDW Publishing</ref> which Mac intends to use to re-write the Mirror Universe's history to prevent the Alliance from taking over his galaxy. His plan is foiled by the crews of the ''Excalibur'', the ''Trident'', and Bravo Station, and his counterpart from the prime universe, Captain Calhoun, who cautions him not to try to reshape an entire universe, lest catastrophic results occur. When Calhoun tells him that Admiral Shelby is aboard Bravo Station, which is being pummeled by the ''Paradox'', Mac surrenders, and the ''Paradox'' is destroyed. Mac takes his crew back to the Mirror Universe, where the mirror McHenry reveals that he arranged the confrontation between the two Calhouns so that Mac would reach the right conclusion himself, and call off the plan.<ref name=Turnaround5/>

Mac next appears in "Homecoming", a short story in the 2009 anthology ''Star Trek: Mirror Universe - Shards and Shadows''. The ''Stinger'' has now been renamed the ''Excalibur'', and has embarked on a campaign against the Alliance, gathering a small army as it attacks Alliance colonies, becoming a symbol of the rebellion. The ''Excalibur'' rescues the Mirror [[The Schizoid Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Selar]] from an escape pod. Selar, a scientist and spy disguised as a Romulan named Thue, was part of a team en route to [[Romulus]] to assemble a [[thalaron bomb]] in order to establish weapons parity with the Alliance. Her cargo vessel, which carried the bomb's final component, C-170, was attacked by the Alliance to prevent the Romulans from using the bomb against them. The ''Excalibur'' crew track down the hijacked supply ship and retake it, before journeying to Romulus with the C-170. As they assemble the bomb, they are confronted by Praetor Hiren, meeting Mac for the first time since his childhood. Hiren is forced into an allegiance with Mac against the Alliance, who arrive to take possession of the thalaron bomb, which they intend to test detonate on Romulus. During the ensuing melee, Hiren, who had tried to prevent an open confrontation with the Alliance, orders his forces in orbit to attack the Alliance ship battling the ''Excalibur'', and the bomb is accidentally detonated. Mac and his crew, along with Hiren, are transported to the ''Excalibur''. Romulus is rendered uninhabitable for a millennium, with only 50,000 Romulans surviving among their fleet - which, on Hiren's orders, proceeds to join Mac's rebel forces.<ref>Peter David. "Homecoming"; ''Star Trek Mirror Universe: Shards and Shadows'' 2009; [[Pocket Books]]; Pages 271-310.</ref>

==Personality and appearance==
Calhoun is depicted as intelligent, cunning, canny,<ref>''House of Cards'', page 7</ref> resourceful and sneaky.<ref>David, Peter. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Into the Void'', 1997, Page 17.</ref> His success as a tactician is due in part to his ability to sense imminent danger, and anticipate his enemies' moves.<ref>''House of Cards'' page 12</ref><ref>David, Peter. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Blind Man's Bluff'', 2011, Pocket Books, page 2</ref> As a young rebel, he trained himself to control his respiration, heartbeat and pulse in order to make himself a more efficient killer, though Peter David has explicitly made it unclear whether this ability is common to Xenexians or unique to Calhoun.<ref>''Blind Man's Bluff'', pages 2 and 81</ref> 

[[Edward Jellico]] sees Calhoun as an unpredictable maverick<ref>''House of Cards'' page 139</ref> and a cowboy,<ref>''House of Cards'' page 140</ref> and [[Jean-Luc Picard]] has observed that reverence was never one of Calhoun's strong suits.<ref>''House of Cards'' page 154</ref> Calhoun feels that, deep down, he is a savage, and that any appearance of civilization on his part is a façade that he wears like a cloak, though he keeps the scar Falkar gave him as a reminder of his roots.<ref>''House of Cards'' pages 155-156</ref> Calhoun has commented on his personality thus: "I’m an officer. I’m just not a gentleman."<ref>''Into the Void'', Page 36</ref>

Like all Xenexians, Calhoun resembles a [[human]] almost entirely, with the exception of his [[purple]] eyes. His skin has a leathery, burnished texture, the years of hardship he endured early in life having given him a weathered look, with several deep creases already lining his forehead by the time he was 19. Calhoun has a scar down the right side of his face from his right temple down across his cheek, left by the wound Falkar inflicted on him with his short sword in 2373.<ref>''House of Cards'' page 24</ref> He is a head shorter than his older brother, D'ndai.<ref>''House of Cards'' page 36</ref> The renditions of Calhoun on the ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier|New Frontier]]'' novel covers, and in the comic book ''Double Time'', consistently depict him as resembling a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] human male with dark brown hair, though it appears as black in ''Turnaround''.

The Mirror Universe Mac has been described as having black hair,<ref name=Obsidian/> and appears thus in ''Turnaround''. Whereas our universe's Calhoun has a scar down the right side of his face, the mirror Calhoun has one down the left side of his.<ref name=Turnaround4>Peter David. ''Star Trek: New Frontier: Turnaround'' #4 (April 2008) [[IDW Publishing]], Page 22.</ref> Mac spent a year on Romulus educating himself in areas such as [[philosophy]], war strategy, and [[chess]]. He learned to defend himself during his many years in the Reman mines.<ref name=Obsidian/>

==Influences==
Fans have noted the similarity between Calhoun and another of [[Peter David]]'s ''[[Star Trek]]'' characters, Commander Quintin Stone from David's 1991 ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|TNG]]'' novel, ''A Rock and a Hard Place''.<ref>[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/004131.html Peter David. "What'cha wanna know?"; June 20, 2006 entry on Peter David's blog; June 20, 6:25pm post.]</ref> David has explained that Calhoun was not intentionally a remodeled Stone, but that interestingly, both were based to some extent by characters portrayed by film actor [[Mel Gibson]]: the apparently unstable "cowboy diplomat" Stone was based on [[Martin Riggs]] from the ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' films, and Calhoun, who was a rebel leader at 20, was inspired by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] rebel leader [[William Wallace]] from ''[[Braveheart]]''. David has added that Calhoun is closer to the historical Wallace, in that like Calhoun, Wallace was much younger than the real-life Gibson was when he portrayed Wallace in the movie.<ref>[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000870.html Peter David."WHAT'CHA WANNA KNOW?"; October 21, 2003 entry on Peter David's blog; October 21, 2:06am post.]</ref>

In addition, Calhoun, who is depicted as something of a cowboy, has been compared by other characters in the stories to [[James T. Kirk]], as in a conversation with [[Edward Jellico]] in the novel ''Martyr''. David has stated that on his blog that Calhoun indeed looks up to and identifies with Kirk, seeing himself very much in the cowboy mold that Kirk personified.<ref>[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000817.html Peter David. "WHAT'CHA WANNA KNOW?"; November 26, 2003 entry on Peter David's blog; November 26, 11:43am post.]</ref>

==In other media==
[[Playmates (Toy Company)|Playmates Toys]] produced a limited edition Captain Calhoun 4.5&nbsp;inch [[action figure]] which was available only via mail order through the ''Star Trek Communicator'' fan club magazine, and began shipping in September 1998. There were approximately 10,000 of these figures produced.<ref name="actionfigad">Advertisement printed on the inside back cover of multiple ''Star Trek'' novels published in 1998 and 1999.</ref>

In September 2005, Calhoun made a [[cameo appearance]] in "Vigil", a sixth-season episode of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fan film]] series ''[[Star Trek: Hidden Frontier]]'', in which he meets his old lover, Elizabeth Shelby, now commanding the ''Excelsior'', in the [[Briar Patch (Star Trek)|Briar Patch]]. Calhoun was played by [[James Cawley]], producer and star of ''[[Star Trek: New Voyages]]'', in which he plays [[James T. Kirk]]. [[Peter David]] stated on his blog that although the creators of the episode did not check with him beforehand, he thought it was very entertaining.<ref>[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/005313.html Peter David. "Q&A"; April 14, 2007 entry on Peter David's blog; April 16, 2007 12:42am post.]</ref>

In the online game ''[[Star Trek Online]]'', Calhoun is a Starfleet mission contact based on Starbase K-7. He issues [[player versus player|PvP]] missions to Federation players so they can fight other STO players playing the Klingon faction.<ref>[http://www.strategycore.co.uk/articles/previews/star-trek-online-preview/ "Star Trek: Online Preview"], Strategy Core, February 1, 2010</ref>
