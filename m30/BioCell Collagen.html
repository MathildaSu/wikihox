'''BioCell Collagen''' is a [[brand name]] for a [[hydrolyzed]] [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) of the [[hyaline cartilage]] ([[articular cartilage]]) of chicken [[sternum]], which naturally contains [[collagen type II]] and [[glycosaminoglycans]] (GAGs). It is different from [[hydrolyzed collagen]] also called collagen hydrolysate, [[gelatin]], or gelatin hydrolysate, due to the presence of collagen type II instead of [[collagen type I]] and its co-presence of substantial amount of GAGs such as [[hyaluronic acid]] and [[chondroitin sulfate]].<ref> Vaughan, L., Mendler, M., Huber, S., Bruckner, P., Winterhalter, K., Irwin, M., and Mayne, R.

== Source and production ==
BioCell Collagen is derived from the [[hyaline cartilage]] in the [[sternum]] of young chicken employing a [[hydrolysis]] manufacturing process. The process of hydrolysis involves not only breaking down the molecular linkages in the triple helix of [[collagen]] trimers called [[tropocollagen]] but significantly reducing the molecular weight (or [[molecular mass]]) of collagen monomers to short chains of [[polypeptides]].
