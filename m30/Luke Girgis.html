== Career ==

Girgis, historically a performing artist, fell into artist management in 2007 in an effort to assist his friends in developing their music projects. He began his management work whilst juggling employment as a support worker for high risk teens in out of home care, but soon transitioned into management as a professional service.

In 2010 Girgis launched a small independent record label ''I Forget, Sorry!'', an umbrella for the artists he managed, including Chance Waters and '''Mind Over Matter''.<ref>{{cite web|title = Run To Damascus Hide & Seek Interview|url = http://www.projectu.tv/run-to-damascus-hide-seek-interview/|website = Project U|accessdate = 11 January 2016}}</ref> '''''It was under this label that one of his first signings Chance Waters (formerly Phatchance) saw his first national successes, with the title single to his debut record achieving regular rotation on national broadcaster '''''[[Triple J]].''' ''With the early momentum of '''I Forget, Sorry!'s''' independent releases, Girgis negotiated the release of Chance Waters debut album '''Infinity''' through Australia's largest independent record label, '''Shock Records''',<ref>{{cite web|title = Chance Waters Signs To Permanent Records|url = http://allaussiehiphop.com/2012/09/10/chance-waters-signs-to-permanent-records/|website = All Aussie HipHop|accessdate = 11 January 2016}}</ref> the same label he would later assume direction of.

In 2013, off the back of multiple placings in the 2012 '''Triple J''' [[Hottest 100]] Girgis negotiated a multi album major label deal for '''Chance Waters''' with [[Island Records Australia]], a subsidiary of the [[Universal Music Group]], as well as a publishing contract with [[Universal Music Publishing]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Exclusive Chance Waters Signs To Island Universal|url = http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2013/07/01/exclusive-chance-waters-signs-to-island-universal/|website = The Music|accessdate = 11 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Publisher News April 2013|url = http://aprap.apra-amcos.com.au/vol-3-2012/publisher-news-april-2013/|website = Apra Amcos|accessdate = 11 January 2016}}</ref> In the same year he established his independent management company '''Be Like Children''' with the mission statement to be ''"always artist first"''.

In 2014 Girgis won a place in the prestigious '''The Seed''' Arts Music Grant, joining a list of alumni that include [[Boy & Bear]] and [[Tame Impala]].<ref>{{cite web|title = 2015 Successful Applicants and Pozible Campaign|url = http://www.theseedfund.org/_blog/Latest_News/post/2015-successful-applicants-and-pozible-campaign/|website = The Seed Fund|accessdate = 11 January 2016}}</ref> The same year he assumed management of Sydney based [[pop rock]] act '''Little Sea''' who under his tutelage would quickly sign a multi album deal with [[Sony Music Australia]] and debut at number 1 on the Australian [[iTunes]] music chart, before touring Australia as main support for international stars [[5 Seconds of Summer]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Interview Little Sea|url = https://studentedge.com.au/article/interview-little-sea|website = [[Student Edge]]|accessdate = 11 January 2016}}</ref>
