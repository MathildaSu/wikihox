'''Anthony Senecal''' is the ex-butler of [[Donald Trump]].  He entered the public spotlight in 2016 when numerous Facebook posts he made were exposed by Mother Jones.  They included calls for executing [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].  Although he endorsed Donald Trump for president, Trump's campaign disavowed Senecal's views when they were made public but still allow him to conduct tours at a Trump property in Florida. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Garafalo|first1=Michael|title=10 things you need to know about Trumpâ€™s racist ex-butler who threatened Obama on Facebook|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/13/10_things_you_need_to_know_about_trumps_racist_ex_butler_who_threatened_obama_on_facebook/|publisher=Salon.com}}</ref>
