'''Daniel Romanovsky''' is an Israeli [[historian]] and a professor at the Vidal Sassoon International Center 
for the Study of Antisemitism at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. His main area of interest is [[anti-semitism]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. 

==Biography==
He was born in [[Leningrad]], [[Russia]] to an assimilated Jewish family. After his marriage and the birth of his first child he became interested in [[Jewish history]], especially of the Holocaust.  Research on the topic was difficult in the [[Soviet Union]] because of government restrictions. He interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in [[Belarus]] and recorded their stories.  He made contact with other interested people and contributed to [[samizdat]] publications on the history of Soviet Jews.  In 1988 he and his wife Elena moved to [[Israel]].  Since then he has contributed to many scholarly works on the topic. He has also lectured on the Holocaust to Russian, Byelorussian, Latvian, and Estonian educators under the auspices of [[Yad Vashem]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/seminars/seminar_pdf/seminar_march_19_20_10.pdf|title=Seminar for Russian Educators |year=2010|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/seminars/seminar_pdf/seminar_7_24.pdf|title=Seminar for Estonian Teachers|year=2010|publisher=Yad Vashem|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.academia.edu/3714937/Seminar_for_Latvian_Educators_International_School_for_Holocaust_Studies_ISHS_Yad_Vashem|title=Seminar for Latvian Educators|year=2010|publisher=Yad Vashem|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/seminars/seminar_pdf/seminar_march_21_30_11.pdf|title=Seminar for Educators from Russia and Byelorussia|year=2011|publisher=Yad Vashem|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>
