The '''[[Leicester]] International Short [[Film Festival]]''' began with humble beginnings back in 1996 using the name, "Seconds Out". the intention had been to exhibit work created by the U.K's east midlands film making [[community]]. However, it has since became one of the most important Short film festivals in the U.K., and has gained recognition from around the world.

Known as the "CAN" film festival, uniquely develops creative potential. The event organisers wish to expand its stature in conjunction with film-makers. Lineout [http://www.lineout.org/] continually seeks [[partnership]] & [[sponsorship]] opportunities for this work.
