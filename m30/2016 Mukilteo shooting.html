== Attack ==
The incident took place on an early Saturday morning. Around 20 university and high school students were attending a house party in an upscale district of Seattle. The gunman opened fire not long after he arrived at the party just after midnight local time. The gunmen approached a fireplace in the backyards and shot two students. He then went on the roof of the building and began firing down onto a group of people. Some survivors hid and contacted their relatives during the shooting. Three people were killed and one person was injured.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/dead-shooting-small-washington-town-article-1.2732039</ref> The suspect then fled the house. He was arrested on an interstate by state troopers over 100 miles away from the place where the incident took place in [[Lewis County]]. The arrest followed the shooting.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/3-dead-1-hurt-in-shooting-near-seattle-suspect-in-custody/2016/07/31/998ef712-56ee-11e6-b652-315ae5d4d4dd_story.html</ref>
