== Claim to the Thrones of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh ==
His claim to the thrones of the Kingdoms of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu-Kashmir]] and Ladakh comes from being the last of the [[Dogra Rajput|House of Dogra]] not under obligation to serve or recive benifit from the Republic of India. He is a decendant of [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria|Genreal Zorawar Singh Kahluria]] by lineage through his father [[Bhim Singh (politician)|Kunwar Bhim Singh]].<ref name=":1" /> By nataurlising and swearing oath to the [[Queen Elizabeth 2|Queen]] of the [[United Kingdom]] his Indian citizenship was automatically and forcefully terminated; without the provison of appeal; regardless of his wishes; as per Section 9 of the [[Indian nationality law|Citizenship Act, 1955]]. Though this did not effect his rights and staus in Jammu-Kashmir as per [[Article 370|Article 370,]] where the Republic of India has to legally recognise and observe Jammu-Kashmir state subjectship uniquley and separately from it's own.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.india.com/loudspeaker/article-370-all-you-want-to-know-about-the-controversial-article-that-gives-jammu-kashmir-special-status-66117/|title = India.com|last = Jiwrajka|first = Shikar|date = May 28, 2014|work = Article 370: All you want to know about the controversial article that gives Jammu & Kashmir special status|access-date = }}</ref> Love further states that by Article 370, the Republic has to legally itself "automatically" recognise his rights of status, inheritance and heritage in relation to Jammu-Kashmir, even though he is no longer citizen of the Republic. Being the last of the [[Dogra Rajput|House of Dogra]] not subject to the Sovereignty of the Republic of India, he believes that this written and ratifed law from 1950 has acted as automatic [[Dejure]] legal recognition by the Republic of India of his [[Sovereignty]] and that of his Kingdoms as he is entitled to by the unique treatment of Juammu-Kashmir status and so the inheritance and heritage rights so enshried by Article 370 for all Jammu-Kashmir subjects and their property.<ref name=":1" />[[File:Ankit Love's 2006 Republic of Inda passport.jpg|thumb|Ankit Love's 2006 Republic of India Passport inside back and front page.]]

He views them each uniquly for their heritage yet as United Kingdoms.

== Claim to Buddhahood & Spirytual-Kingdom of Tibet ==
Ankit Love believes himself to be the rightful Syprtual-King of Tibet. He basies his spritual claim in part on being born to Mother Malati granddaughter of a [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] Priest of a village near [[Nepal]] in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] where the last [[Gautama_Buddha|Buddha]]'s cremation site is located. He also places claim to Buddhood based on the [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria#Tibet expedition|Tibet expidition]] which resulted in the slaying of his ancestorial grand fahter General Zorwar Singh Kahluria by a Tibtian horseman percing the General's heart with a spear. Love believes that his ancestor was slayed by decption and treacery and that of an unholy alliance between the Lama Guru Sahib Lasa and Emperor of China and even his own King and Dogra Clan leader the [[Maharaja Gulab Singh|Mahārāja Gulab Singh]]. All for what Ankit Love calls a short term business deal done for the "traffic in shawl, pasham, and teas," as outlined in the [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria#The Treaty of Chushul|Treaty of Chushul]].<ref>The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P. Rubin, The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 1. (Jan., 1960), pp. 96-125.</ref> Love believes the betryal of business over clan honor and the cursed spilling of his ancestoral blood on the heartlands of Tibet by a Tibitain horseman gives him entitlment to the lost [[Tibet (1912–51)|Kingdom of Tibet]]. He further believes that this and other signs, that he plans to reveal in an epic book he is now writing, give him claim to being a [[Buddhahood|new Buddha]] too, known as [[Yojana]]-Buddha.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

He has decreed for the [[China|People's Republic of China]] to end it's occupation by a smooth tranisation and orderly withdraw from his Kingdom and to allow for his subjects to return to their spiritual homelands and be treated fairly and to be allowed to live and pracitce their spirtuality in love, peace, harmony and prosperity. He claims that he fears that if China disobeys him they may face tragic [[Dharma|Dharmic]] consequences.<ref name=":1" />
