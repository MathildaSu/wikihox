The '''Eta Phi Zeta''' sorority is a nonprofit organization which currently conducts cívic, social, and cultural  activities to benefit society in [[Puerto Rico]]

In 1969, a group of college students in Arecibo, who were the wives and girlfriends of members of the [[Phi Zeta Chi]] fraternity, indicated their interest in forming a sorority which would be affiliated with that fraternity. The Alpha chapter was the first to be formed, in 1969, at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo]]. In 1970, some of the sorority members transferred to study at [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico]] in San Germán and recruited other women to form the second chapter there, named Beta. In 1971, the Gamma chapter was founded at [[Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico]] in Ponce and the Delta chapter at UIA. In 1973 the Epsilon chapter was founded at Humacao. In 1974, two more chapters were founded, Iota at [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez]] and Kappa at Aguadilla (CORA). In 1989 the Lambda chapter was founded at Aguadilla {UIA), Mu at [[Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez]], and Eta at [[University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus]]. The most recently founded chapter was Zeta in 1966 {{When|date=September 2016}} at [[University of Puerto Rico at Utuado]]. Currently, {{When|date=September 2016}} the organization has eight active chapters: Alpha, Beta, Iota, Mu, Gamma, Delta, Kappa and Zeta.
