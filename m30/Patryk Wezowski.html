== Background ==

Wezowski moved with his parents from [[Poland]] to [[Belgium]] when he was four. He had difficulty adjusting to new environment because he didn’t speak Dutch and suffered from a hearing disorder that made it so  he couldn’t distinguish words from a noisy background,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://myjour.com/a/change/lichaamstaal-meer-te-vertrouwen-dan-een-leugendetector/ Body language: more confidence than a lie |title=myjour|publisher=Eric Segers|date=2013-08-03|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> called perception deafness. This made it difficult for him to communicate with other children, until he discovered that he could read a lot from their body language.

Wezowski started giving training in fencing in the fencing club of his father when he was 14.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/How-Micro-Expressions-Predict-S;search%3Atag%3A%22tedxuhasseltsalon%22 How Micro Expressions Predict Success |title=Ted|publisher=Ted|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>  He dreamt about studying psychology, but his parents decided that economics would be better for his future. After advancing quickly in his 20 to director’s positions in various companies, he started building his own business, focusing on sales and body language. Throughout his career, Wezowski had a multi-disciplinary approach and a vast knowledge of non-verbal communication, psychology, sales, and marketing. He consulted many start-up companies.
Due to his earlier hearing disorder, Wezowski has an ability to read and accurately interpret body language signals. By starting giving training since his 14 year old, he became a keynote speaker and likes to inspire people. Wezowki is often invited to present to large audiences, and has been speaking at the NexusEQ conference at [[Harvard University]] <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nexuseq.com/members/patryk-kasia Patryk & Kasia Wezowski |title=NEXUSEQ|publisher=NEXUSEQ|date=2013-06-24|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> and Pioneers Festival in [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pioneers.io/people/patryk-kasia-wezowski |title= Pioneers.io |publisher=ProSiebenSat.1 Puls4|date=2013-06-24|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> The Center for Body Language he founded with his wife Kasia Wezowski, is the world’s largest company providing body language training with a focus on business people.{{fact|date=May 2014}}

== Books ==

Wezowski co-authored the bestselling book “The Micro Expressions Book For Business”<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Micro-Expressions-Book-Business/dp/9081990519/ Micro Expression Book Business|title=Amazon |publisher=Amazon|date=2012-09-23|accessdate=2014-02-02}}</ref> and “Lichaamstaal”,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lannoo.be/lichaamstaal-0 |title=Lichaamstaal |publisher=Lannoo|date=2012-09-23|accessdate=2014-02-02}}</ref> translating non-verbal communication science into the language of entrepreneurs and presenting a practical approach how to use body language in business meetings. His books teach how to read micro expressions to obtain a decisive advantage for everybody involved in sales, recruitment, negotiations, leadership, coaching and training. He also co-authored a book about one of the methods he created to alleviate stress in stressful situations, called “How to Reduce Stress with the Emotional Management Method”. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amazon.com/Reduce-Stress-Emotional-Management-Method/dp/9081990500/ Reduce Stress Emotional Management Method|title=Amazon|publisher=Amazon|date=2012-10-18|accessdate=2014-02-02}}</ref>
== Micro Expressions ==

Wezowski’s specialization is teaching how to use recognition of micro expressions in business situations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20130327_00520808 Even Silent Speak Volumes|title=dS
De Standaard|publisher=Lance Armstrong|date=2013-03-28|accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> Wezowski defines “Micro Expressions” as subtle muscle movements of the face that last half a second or less.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.communication-director.eu/issues/corporate-media-mix/body-language-career-management Body language in career management|title=Communication Director |publisher= Communication Director Magezine|date=2013-11-08|accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> Micro expressions are involuntary and express emotions that we experience at a particular moment. Micro expressions are universally shown in the same way in every culture. Research on blind people from birth <ref> Cole, P. M., Jenkins, P. A., & Shott, C. T. (1989). Spontaneous expressive control in blind and sighted children. Child Development, 60(3), 683-688.</ref> confirms that Micro Expressions are not culturally learnt but we are already equipped with that information on the biological level when we are born. Micro expressions are the result of how our brain translates emotional impulses. Moreover, most people can’t control these involuntary muscle contractions, which are triggered directly by their limbic system. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/article_889bdff2-25f5-11e2-85ad-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm Facial ‘micro expressions’ show true feelings about Obama, Romney|title=Journal Now|publisher=Winston Salem Journal|date=2012-11-03|accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref>(Source: “The Micro Expressions Book For Business”)

== Micro Expressions Research ==

In a study in 2012, Wezowski his spouse Kasia Wezowski used facial recognition to predict outcome of the [[US]] presidential election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.phillyrecord.com/2012/11/new-polling-marvel-let-your-face-predict-your-vote Your Face Predict Your Vote|title=NEW POLLING MARVEL|publisher=Philadelphia The Public Record|date=2012-11-02|accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> They measured the voters’ emotions during the presidential election, by using webcams recognizing facial expressions of people watching the candidates’ speeches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/videozone/programmas/reyerslaat/2.30249?video=1.1743271  Body explains |title=The Success of Bart De Wever|publisher=De Redactie.Be|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> Their study showed why the election was almost a tie, with a very slight advantage for [[Obama]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/article_889bdff2-25f5-11e2-85ad-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm Facial ‘micro expressions’ show true feelings about Obama, Romney|title=Journal Now|publisher=Winston Salem Journal|date=2012-11-03|accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> By being able to detect precisely what emotions each fragment of the candidates’ speeches evokes, Wezowski’s study reported on how the candidates would perform in the election. In this election, [[Obama]] won with a slight advantage and Wezowski’s analysis proved to be accurate. Wezowski has used the same methodology to predict the results of other elections in [[Belgium]] and [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/videozone/programmas/reyerslaat/2.30249?video=1.1743271  Body explains |title=The Success of Bart De Wever|publisher=De Redactie.Be|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>
Next to predicting election outcomes, Wezowski has used micro expressions to predict the outcome of an investors competition at Pioneers Festival in 2013,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pioneers.io/people/patryk-kasia-wezowski |title= Pioneers.io |publisher=ProSiebenSat.1 Puls4|date=2013-06-24|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> by recording and analysing the body language of the jury, before the contest results were announced.

Wezowski and Kasia Wezowski have published the results from their research in companies at the NexusEQ conference at Harvard University,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nexuseq.com/members/patryk-kasia Patryk & Kasia Wezowski |title=NEXUSEQ|publisher=NEXUSEQ|date=2013-06-24|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> stating that being able to read facial expressions and body language accurately, increases ones emotional intelligence score on the [[MSCEIT]] test with an average of 10%. They also found a correlation in companies like [[BMW]] ([[Rome]]), [[Myo]] ([[Italy]]), [[GTS]] ([[Slovakia]]) and in a few companies in [[Belgium]] that sales professionals who score above average on their micro expressions test sell 20% more products.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/How-Micro-Expressions-Predict-S;search%3Atag%3A%22tedxuhasseltsalon%22 How Micro Expressions Predict Success|title=Ted|publisher=Ted|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>
