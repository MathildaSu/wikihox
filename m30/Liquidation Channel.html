'''Liquidation Channel''' (LC), is a subsidiary of Vaibhav Global Limited (VGL).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vaibhavglobal.com/about.html |title=Introduction to VGL |publisher=Vaibhav Global Ltd. |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> It is an Omni-Channel retailer comprised of a [[home shopping]] television network, an [[e-commerce]] business, and an [[outside sales]]/wholesale segment. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, the company strives to have all areas of the business complement each other and is one of the fastest growing [[Jewelry]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|Lifestyle]] [[retail business]] in the [[US]]. Fully integrated, LC manufactures more than half of the products it sells.<ref name=AboutUs>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidationchannel.com/index.php?file=allfile&id=1 |title=Liquidation Channel About Us |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> The television channel broadcasts live 24 hours a day, 365 days a year in the United States, Puerto Rico, and areas of Canada. 

LC has direct relationships with many mines around the world, eliminating many of the middlemen in the jewelry industry.  This allows LC to offer customers (also called family members) the lowest prices in the industry, confirmed by their Lowest Price Guarantee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidationchannel.com/faq.html#lowestPriceGuarantee |title=Liquidation Channel Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>  If a customer finds the same item advertised by television or newspaper to a national audience for less, LC will pay him or her the difference, plus an additional 20 percent.

LC specializes in rare and exotic gemstones, making fine jewelry more accessible to everyone.  One of their most popular gemstones is [[tanzanite]]. The TanzaniteOne Mining Ltd. in Tanzania, Africa, the largest miner and supplier of tanzanite in the world, only allows eight companies hold the honor of being a [[sightholder]]. And the LC has the number one sightholder position with this mine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tanzaniteone.com/sightholders |title=Tanzanite One Sightholders |publisher=Tanzanite One |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI-NFAVozps |title=Liquidation Channel Global Hotwire: Tanzanite One Mine |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> Tanzania is the only source in the world for this blue/purple gemstone.

==History==
The company was originally established as The Jewelry Channel, Inc.—still its legal name—with a product line mainly focused on high end items.  In March 2007, economic pressures precipitated an evolution of the business. The company began to focus on providing value jewelry products and transitioned to the Liquidation Channel brand.
 
Liquidation Channel was launched on December 1, 2008.  Gerald Tempton joined the LC family as President on December 23, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Disney exec to lead Austin jewelry company|website=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/01/11/daily52.html|publisher=Austin Business Journal|accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref>  Since then, the company has grown from 58 employees to more than 500.  For the past five consecutive years, the company has seen high double-digit sales increases and even more dramatic profitability increases.
 
In 2010, the company launched their very first Tanzanite Smackdown event, in an effort to go head-to-head with a major competitor who had planned a special tanzanite event.  It soon became one of the company’s marquee events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CK_2f8Hi-s |title=Tanzanite SmackDown Saturday, November 16th |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>  A Tanzanite Smackdown event runs for a 24-hour time block (often coast-to-coast) and offers the lowest prices available anywhere for this rare, highly sought after stone.  In fact, since its inception, no other competitor has hosted a 24-hour event focused around Tanzanite, or any other stone.  LC has added Diamond and Emerald Smackdowns to their lineup of special events. They also feature many other 24-hour events focusing on one gemstone with tremendous success.
 
In 2012, the company began evolving their brand and logo from Liquidation Channel to LC—a change inspired by how the company was most often referenced by its family members.

In 2014, LC began to push to expand their lifestyle accessory product offerings, such as handbags, hair accessories, and home décor products.

==Format==
LC broadcasts to more than 120 million homes in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada and serves Mexico via e-commerce at liquidationchannel.com.  The television channel is nationally broadcast on AT&T, DirecTV, Dish Network, and Verizon, as well as many other broadcasters.  The channel can also be accessed via Roku, Google TV, Samsung TV, Amazon Fire, and streams live on liquidationchannel.com.<ref name=AboutUs /> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidationchannel.com/tvauction.html |title=Liquidation Channel Current On Air Item |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>

The television channel operates in a reverse auction format.  The channel will feature an item, and show a starting price and quantity available.  They will then drop that amount down to the Liquidation Channel price.  Occasionally the price will continue to drop down even more, depending on the item.  In some instances, additional quantities of an item may be added, if more of the specific item are discovered in the inventory.<ref name=AboutUs />

The host will continue to talk about the item, mentioning various aspects of the item such as size, gemstone, and other important information (such as additional sizes, stone cut, carat size, etc.) during which time a countdown clock runs (on the right side of the screen) and the quantity decreases as items are sold.  If the item sells out before the clock expires, LC goes to the next item.

The price shown does not include shipping and handling charges. Shipping and Handling charges are determined by the day of sale or any special deals being offered.  Shipping charges can range from $1.99 to $2.99 depending on the day the item is sold, and if any specials are being offered, it is shown on the screen during the broadcast.  As the company is based in Austin, Texas residents also have to pay state sales tax for any items purchased (tax is charged on both the item price and the shipping charge).

Liquidation Channel is an All Sales Final company for items sold at less than $200 and these items are non-returnable.  Occasionally LC will designate some items as returnable, and those items will display that in the item description (located in the lower right side of the screen).  Returnable items have a 30 day window in order to return an item.

==Programs==
In addition to the Smackdown events and the television channel's reverse auction format, LC hosts an extensive catalog and a Rising Auction web platform which auctions off individual products with a timed live auction format. All Rising Auction items start at $1 and have no reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidationchannel.com/index.php?file=auctionhelp |title=Liquidation Channel Auction & Bidding Help|publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>
 
In 2010, the company began promoting a daily special entitled, Today’s Liquidation Value (TLV).  These items are considered the biggest value piece of the day.  Prices are only good during the 24-hour period in which the TLV aired.  The TLV airs at eight specific times throughout the day, and TLV items change every day.  TLV air times are 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., 4:30 p.m., 8 p.m., and 11 p.m. CT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidationchannel.com/index.php?file=productlist&search_flag=search&keyword=lc_tlv&cm_sp=Banner-_-topbanner5-_-tlv |title=Liquidation Channel Today's Liquidation Value |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>
 
Arming customers with knowledge is a key element to fulfilling LC’s promise of “Exceptional Quality, Exquisite Designs, and Outstanding Value.” Tempton and the LC merchandising team travel around the world to find just the right items so that they can continue to deliver on this promise. Global Hotwire videos highlight these trips and provide customers with an all-access pass to the stories behind the gemstones and the exotic lands where the company does business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidationchannel.com/pages/education-global-hotwire-videos.html |title=Liquidation Channel Global Hotwire and Videos |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>
 
LC’s Education Center launched July 2014. This special area of the LC website is a tool that was developed to help customers grow their understanding about their favorite jewelry pieces and gemstones. The Education Center provides a wealth of information, from gemstone attributes to tips and tricks on how to style each jewelry or accessory piece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidationchannel.com/pages/education-home.html |title=Liquidation Channel Education Center |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref>
 
The LC Style blog, debuted in 2008 and was re-launched in 2014 as an engaging place where customers can go to get the latest fashion trends and tips, while still getting to know their LC Family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.liquidationchannel.com/ |title=LC Style Blog |publisher=Liquidation Channel |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> Throughout each month, LC Style showcases different “How-To Guides.” Plus, customers can get to know the LC Hosts on a more personal level.

==Philanthropy==
LC’s commitment to social responsibility can be seen in the work the company does through its LC Cares programs.  With a primary focus on health and education, the company believes that when you do well, you must also do good. 
 
The company has made financial and material donations through the former Tanzanite Foundation to the Masai Ladies Project and the New Vision Orphanage and School.  LC customers participated in a donation made to the Snowball Express during a special event over Memorial Day Weekend 2014.  In addition to financial and material donations, LC employees volunteer locally in their community.  They have done volunteer events with [[Ronald McDonald House Charities]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[Special Olympics]], and have host food drives to serve local food pantries.  The company has developed a tight partnership with the United Way for Greater Austin and works closely with an Austin middle school.<ref name=AboutUs />
