'''Felix Velarde''' founded one of the world's first web design agencies, Hyperinteractive, in 1994, and was co-founder of ''Head-Space'', one of the first open creative galleries on the web. ''Forbes'' and ''Management Today'' included Head-Space in their lists of the world's ten most influential websites, a pre-cursor to YouTube<ref>[http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/10-websites-changed-world/article/1102817 Management Today], 2011-11-07</ref>. Velarde is currently on the central organising team of [[Vint Cerf]]'s ''People-Centered Internet'' initiative. 

An early specialist web design agency, Hyperinteractive created the first graphical websites for brands including Snickers and Allied Domecq, and created the first interactive awards productions for the [[Cannes Advertising Festival]] and [[D&AD]]. In 1997 he launched [[Head New Media]] with Creative Director [[Jason Michael Holland|Jason Holland]], which became the digital arm of the world's fourth-largest advertising network, [[Interpublic]]'s Lowe & Partners (now [[MullenLowe Profero]]) in 1998. <Head> was the world's most awarded digital agency in 1999. An offshoot, [[Interactive Television]] agency Head End, produced the first [[Interactive Television]] [[commercials]] for [[Tesco]] and [[Unilever]] and built the wapTV developer community for [[Sky]].

In 1996 Velarde was a founder of an innovative<ref>[http://www.creamglobal.com/insight/the-cream-100 The Cream 100 Top Innovators], 2010-04-03</ref> strategy company, [[Underwired]]<ref>[http://www.nma.co.uk/Logon/ResourceBarrier.aspx?RequiredServices=17,|&PipelinedPage=/Articles/16112/That+was+then+NMA+5+September+1996.html&PipelinedQueryString=liArticleID%3d16112 Hyperinteractive launches Underwired], 1996-05-09</ref> which led the growth of the discipline of [[eCRM]] building on the pioneering [[CRM]] work of Oracle's [[Mei Lin Fung]] et al. Having left Head New Media in 2001 he became Underwired's [[CEO]], selling it to Hasgrove PLC in 2009. In 2012 he arranged an [[Management buyout|MBO]] and was Underwired's Chairman until selling his stake<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/02/16/underwired-co-founder-felix-velarde-departs-following-gratterpalm-integration|title=Underwired co-founder Felix Velarde departs following Gratterpalm integration|website=The Drum|access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref> in 2014.

Velarde was also [[CEO]] of an agency [[rollup|roll-up]] ''The Conversation Group'' between 2013 and 2016. He is a [[Non-Executive Director]] of several agencies and start-ups and chairman of ''MomentumABM'', which pioneered Account-Based Marketing.

== Non-Commercial Work ==
While at Head New Media, Velarde and Holland sponsored a non-commercial online creative community, ''Head-Space'', which incubated prominent community websites including [[Urban75]] and [[John Lundberg]] et al.'s Circlemakers.org. Employees at Head New Media were given one day a week to work on Head-Space (the founders of Urban75 and Circlemakers both worked at Head New Media in the 1990s), but contributors came from all over the world. Featured in the travelling exhibition [[Digital Archaeology]] since 2010, [[Head-Space]] is recognised as a digital artefact of considerable historic and cultural relevance, which [[Forbes Magazine]] described as a germinal precursor to [[YouTube]] and one of the world's ten most influential websites.<ref>[http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/features/1102817/10-websites-changed-world/ Ten Websites That Changed The World] ''[[Management Today]]'' 2011-11-07</ref>

From 2006-2008 Velarde was a sponsor of the UK's prototype personal [[carbon trading]] system, CarbonDAQ, a project being led by leading Left-leaning [[think tank]] the [[Royal Society of Arts]], of which he is a [[Fellow]].

In 2015 Velarde became a member of Innovation For Jobs (i4j) Leadership Forum, a [[Silicon Valley]]-based [[think tank]] chaired by co-founder of the Internet [[Vint Cerf]], and David Nordfors. Other participants include former CEO of [[SRI International]] [[Curtis Carlson]], Lord [[Jim Knight]], [[Robin Farmanfarmaian]] and [[Steve Denning]].

Since 2016 he has been on the Organizing Team<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://peoplecentered.net/our-people/|title=Our People|newspaper=People Centered Internet|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref> of the ''[http://peoplecentered.net People-Centered Internet]'' project chaired by Vint Cerf and co-founded by Mei Lin Fung (who invented [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] while at Oracle), which aims to ensure that the Internet's roll-out to developing and emerging countries is guided by principles of [[People-centered development]] rather than commercial focus. The organization works closely with [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]], [[World Economic Forum]], [[World Bank Group]], [[White House|The White House]] and others.
