==Brahma Dharma==
The [[Brahmo religion]] was first codified by Maharshi [[Debendranath Tagore]] with the formulation of the [[Brahmo Dharma Beej]] and publication of the '''Brahma Dharma''' book of 1848/1850 in 2 parts. The Brahma Dharma is the source of every Brahmo's spiritual faith and reflects [[Brahmo]] repudiation of the Hindu Vedas as authority and the shift away from Ram Mohan Roy's Vedantic Unitary God per the Adi Shankara Advaita school. The traditional seed principles and Debendranath's ''Brahmo Dharma'' (or religious and moral law) now stand evolved as the "Fundamental Principles of [[Brahmoism]]" and are supplemented by precise evolving rules for adherents, akin to "Articles of Faith" which regulate the Brahmo way of life. In addition the assembly of Brahmos (and also [[Brahmo Samaj]]ists) for meeting or worship is always consonant with the Trust Principles of 1830 or its derivatives.
