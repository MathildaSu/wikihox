Gamsakhurdia himself said he had never "proclaimed" the slogan and referred to it as "a cynic invention of Moscow's propaganda machine".<ref>Gamsakhurdia, Zviad (1993), "The Nomenklatura Revanche in Georgia".

==Gamsakhurdia era==
Whilst both [[Giorgi Chanturia|Gia Chanturia]]  and [[Merab Kostava]] have been credited with its authorship, the slogan first appeared in April 1989 when political rallies were held in [[Tbilisi]] in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule.<ref name="hatred"/><ref>{{cite news|script-title=ru:Диссидентство с разными лицами или почему Саакашвили не Дубчек?|publisher=Hayinfo|date=22 August 2008|url=http://www.hayinfo.ru/ru/analytics/policy/35381.html|accessdate=2008-09-15|language=ru}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Along with other slogans such as "The Soviet Union is the Prison of Nations" and "Long Live a Free, Democratic Georgia", "Georgia for Georgians" was the most famous, and worked to attract large crowds to the [[nationalist]] demonstrations.<ref name="hatred">{{cite book|last=Kaufman|first=Stuart J.|title=Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2Plw98pTk5wC|accessdate=2008-09-15|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=[[Ithaca]], [[New York]]; [[London]]|isbn=978-0-8014-8736-1|pages=101–102|chapter=Georgia and the Fears of Majorities|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=2Plw98pTk5wC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA85,M1}}</ref> In 1993, Zviad Gamsakhurdia denied ever having "proclaimed" the slogan and dismissed it as an "invention of the Moscow's propaganda machine", at the same time accusing the Western mass media of repeating "in full the elaborate lies of Soviet propaganda".<ref>Gamsakhurdia (1993), ''ibid'' ([http://books.google.com/books?ei=tz6hSeOuDYagyATrzLCMAg&as_brr=0&id=p7ZpAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Georgia+for+the+Georgians%22+%22Soviet+Analyst%22&q=%22lies+of+Soviet+propaganda%22&pgis=1#search_anchor Snappet view] from [[Google Books]])</ref> Zviad's son, [[Konstantine Gamsakhurdia (politician)|Konstantine Gamsakhurdia]], also maintained that his father never actually said the slogan, and claimed the [[South Ossetia]] issue was not about [[nationality]] but politics.<ref>{{cite news | last = Rimple | first = Paul | title = Georgia buries a president, but not the past | publisher = [[EurasiaNet]] | date = 2 April 2007 | url = http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav040207.shtml | accessdate =2008-09-13 }}</ref>

On 26 May 1991, Gamsakhurdia was elected first [[President of Georgia]] with a [[List of landslide victories|landslide victory]] of 86%.

#[[Transnational marriage|Mixed marriage]]s would be discouraged, 
#[[Citizenship]] restricted to people who could prove [[Residency (domicile)|residence]] prior to [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russia's annexation of Georgia]] in 1801, 
#[[Property rights]] would be limited to people who voted for national independence in a referendum in April, 
#"Georgia for Christian Georgians" was promoted, despite the official [[separation of church and state]].

Gamsakhurdia based his ethnic policy on distinguishing between those in Georgia he labeled  "[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]" and "settlers", or "temporary guests", which led Soviet [[dissident]] and [[academic]] [[Andrey Sakharov]] to call Georgia the "little empire".<ref name="polrel"/> The more than 1.5 million ethnic minorities who lived in Georgia were to considered to be the major threat to the Georgian people, which also resulted in [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] propaganda being published in the media.<ref name="polrel"/> In 1989 Gamsakhurdia proclaimed "Today, we are facing a serious problem. Tatars, Armenians and Ossetians have risen to their feet. We must save from foreigners [[Kakhetia]] – our holy land!" <ref>Aris Kazinyan, "Own game" of Mikhail Saakashvili" Regnum, 09-09-2006 http://www.regnum.ru/english/701498.html</ref>

Gamsakhurdia claimed the slogan was directed against the Soviet domination of Georgia.<ref name="dawisha">Dawisha, Karen & Parrot, Bruce (1997), ''[http://books.google.ge/books?id=XvMfeIVY71sC&pg=PA170&lpg=PA170&dq=%22Soviet+domination+of+the+republic%22&source=bl&ots=S_sFpbz-pB&sig=bO1t7s9yJAvpwB5WGgXNi7hhJfk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e0syUOa-O6iL4gSX8oGIDg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Soviet%20domination%20of%20the%20republic%22&f=false Conflict, Cleavage, and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus]'', pp. 170-171. Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521597315.</ref>

Once in power, much of the extreme nationalist agenda was put aside, and he frequently sought to reassure minorities that existing political-administrative system would not be changed without the consent of the respective groups and that the cultural rights of all ethnic groups would be respected. In July 1991, the Parliament of Georgia adopted a law granting citizenship to almost all residents of Georgia.<ref name="dawisha"/>

==Effect on Ossetians==
At a political rally in 1989 in the village of [[Eredvi]], Gamsakhurdia described the [[Ossetians|Ossetian people]] as "trash that has to be swept out through [[Roki tunnel|a tunnel]]",<ref>{{cite news | last = Markedonov | first = Sergey | title = Don't write Russia off yet! | publisher = [[Prague Watchdog]] | date = 29 August 2008 | url = http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000003-000131&lang=1 | accessdate = 2008-09-13 }}</ref> and in 1991 told foreign reporters that Georgia's Ossetians were unwanted "guests" who should "go back" to [[North Ossetia]].<ref name=nyt2>{{cite news | last = Brooke | first = James | title = As Centralized Rule Wanes, Ethnic Tension Rises Anew in Soviet Georgia | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2 October 1991 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D7123CF931A35753C1A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print | accessdate = 2008-09-13}}</ref> He claimed, "in Georgia, there are Ossetians, but no Ossetia".<ref>[http://topics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/how-the-south-ossetians-became-separatists/?scp=1&sq=gamsakhurdia%20ossetians&st=cse How the South Ossetians Became 'Separatists'. NYT]</ref>

This policy resulted in the decision of the South Ossetian parliament in 1989 to declare its intent to unite with North Ossetia as part of the [[Russian Federation]],<ref name="polrel"/> resulting in the revocation of [[South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast|South Ossetia's autonomy]] and the merger of the region by the [[Politics of Georgia (country)|Georgian authorities]] to [[Shida Kartli]] (literally "Interior Georgia").<ref name="polrel"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Abayev|first=Vasso|title=Tragedy of South Ossetia.

==Effect on Abkhazians==
In Georgia, the slogan ''Abkhazia is Georgia'' was also used, although ''Georgia for Georgians'' was the more popular. Protesters at mass rallies in 1989 demanded the abolition of autonomy for Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Gamsakhurdia told West Georgians in an address that he planned to assimilate or oust Abkhazians from their land. Liana Kvarchelia claims his policies found little criticism in the Georgian community, rather the image painted by Gamsakhurdia of an enemy united Georgian society in the midst of internal political struggle.<ref name="kvarchelia">{{cite web|url=http://www.demokratizatsiya.org/Dem%20Archives/DEM%2006-01%20kvarchelia.pdf|title=Georgia-Abkhazia Conflict: View from Abkhazia|last=Kvarchelia|first=Liana|date=June 2001|publisher=[[Demokratizatsiya (journal)|Demokratizatsiya]]|accessdate=2009-03-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The policy was one catalyst which led to Chairman of the Abkhaz [[Supreme Soviet]] [[Vladislav Ardzinba]] to declare "Abkhazia is for Abkhazians", which in turn provoked the [[ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia]].<ref name="polrel"/>

==Effect on other nationalities==
The [[Meskhetian Turks]] who during the [[Great Patriotic War]] were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] by [[Joseph Stalin]] to [[Central Asia]], were unable to return to Georgia under the "Georgia for Georgians" policy. Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaya in a report for the [[Federal Union of European Nationalities]] stated that although there was a small repatriation of Meskhetian Turks to the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the 1970s and 1980s under [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], ''Georgia for Georgians'' had led ''de facto'' to a second deportation from Georgia, and cited the example of a Meskhet settlement in the [[Zulukidse]] region which was destroyed in 1990, and has still not been rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minelres.lv/min/meskh/FUEN_Meskh.htm|title=The Problem of the Repatriation of the Meskhet-Turks|last=Chervonnaya|first=Svetlana|date=November 1998|publisher=Federal Union of European Nationalities|accessdate=2009-03-10}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5fAz19D49 Archived] at [[WebCite]]</ref>

[[Azeris]], numbering 300,000+, received no representation in the [[Parliament of Georgia|Georgian parliament]], and many were forced to move from the land on which they had lived for centuries.<ref name="polrel">{{cite book|last=Bourdeaux|first=Michael|others=Kurbanov, Rafik Osman-Ogly; Kurbanov, Erjan Rafik-Ogly|title=The Politics of Religion in Russia and the New States of Eurasia|url=http://books.google.com/?id=l7NksOAvOqUC|year=1995|publisher=M.E.

==Doctrine in the post-Gamsakhurdia era==

In October 2004 the political scientist Anna Matveeva wrote that nationalism in Georgia "continues to project a climate of 'Georgia for Georgians' where minorities are expected to feel privileged that they are allowed to reside on the territory of the Georgian state", and that although Georgia has substantial ethnic diversity, its "political culture is characterized by an exclusive ethnic nationalism so profound that minorities are not accepted as fully-fledged citizens of the country".<ref name="unhcr"/> In 2005 [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], the then-President of Georgia, stated that ''Georgia for Georgians'' is a "poisonous nationalistic slogan" and he would implement a new policy which "declares Georgia the motherland of all its citizens."<ref name="saakashvili">{{Cite web|last=Saakashvili|first=Mikheil|authorlink=Mikheil Saakashvili|title=Eurasia: It Takes a Cultural Revolution|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=20 August 2005|url=http://www.president.gov.ge/?l=E&m=0&sm=10&st=70&id=455|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref> However, Georgian politician-in-exile [[Igor Giorgadze]] and Professor of [[Political Science]] at the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]] [[Andranik Migranyan]] alleged that the doctrine continued to be used by the political [[The Establishment|establishment]] in Georgia under Saakashvili.<ref>{{cite news | last = Giorgadze | first = Igor | title = Georgia should be the Switzerland of the Caucasus | publisher = [[Taipei Times]] | date = 3 October 2006 | url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/10/03/2003330263 | accessdate = 2008-09-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Migranyan|first=Andranik|title=Georgia Propelling Its Disintegration|journal=[[Russia in Global Affairs]]|volume=4|issue=October–December 2004|pages=125|publisher=Globus Publishing House|location=[[Moscow]]|url=http://www.eng.globalaffairs.ru/docs/2004_english4.pdf|accessdate=2008-09-14 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
