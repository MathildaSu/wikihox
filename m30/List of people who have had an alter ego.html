An [[alter ego]] is a [[persona]] that is used by some stage or screen [[Play (theatre)|performers]] or [[actor]]s.  An alter ego is not the same as a [[stage name]].

Comic performers sometimes use an alter ego as a part of their routines.

* The [[Marx Brothers]] performed throughout their careers as [[vaudeville]] characters. [[Groucho Marx|Julius Marx]] would play various roles and would be credited as "Groucho" whether he was cast a professor (as in ''[[Horse Feathers]]''), a veterinarian (''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]''), or a president (''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'').

* [[Stand-up comedy|Stand-up comedians]] such as [[Don Rickles]] (Mr. Warmth) and [[Jackie Mason]] (Hartounian) can be said to have developed their [[shtick]] into distinct alter egos.

* [[Andy Kaufman]] was known to fans chiefly through several characters, including the Foreign Man (later [[Latka Gravas]]), [[Tony Clifton]], and Kaufman's impersonation of [[Elvis Presley]]. The [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' depicts Kaufman as a man whose true identity was difficult to define because of the prevalence of these alter egos.

[[Professional wrestling|Professional wrestlers]], more often than not, perform under a [[Ring name|"ring name"]] depicting an alter ego. Examples are:

* Terry Bollea ([[Hulk Hogan]])
* Mark Calaway ([[The Undertaker]])
* Paul Levesque ([[Triple H]])
* Mike Mizanin ([[The Miz]])
* Phillip Brooks ([[CM Punk]])
