'''Puppy chow''' is a form of [[chocolate]]-based confectionery in the United States. Different versions of the [[recipe]] call for different levels of ingredients, but they all produce generally the same result: [[cereal]] coated with melted chocolate, [[peanut butter]], and powdered sugar.

The name "puppy chow" is based on look and consistency of this snack, which resembles the [[Dog Chow]] brand of dog food in its appearance.<ref>[http://blog.chron.com/marcistable/2012/12/happy-holidays-and-happy-hard-work/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref>
