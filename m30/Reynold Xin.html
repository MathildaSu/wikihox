'''Reynold Xin''' is a [[computer scientist]] and [[engineer]] specializing in [[big data]], [[distributed systems]], and [[cloud computing]]. He is a co-founder and Chief Architect of [[Databricks]]. He is a frequent speaker on the topic of Big Data and open source software at conferences. He is best known for his work on [[Apache Spark]], most recently as the release manager for Spark's 2.0 release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/ANNOUNCE-Announcing-Apache-Spark-2-0-0-td18471.html|title=Apache Spark Developers List - [ANNOUNCE] Announcing Apache Spark 2.0.0|website=apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref> He is also the most active contributor to Spark with over 1000 commits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apache/spark/graphs/contributors|title=apache/spark|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref>

== Biography ==

=== UC Berkeley ===
Xin started his work on the Spark open source project while he was a PhD candidate at the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] AMPLab.

The first research project, Shark<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xin|first=Reynold S.|last2=Rosen|first2=Josh|last3=Zaharia|first3=Matei|last4=Franklin|first4=Michael J.|last5=Shenker|first5=Scott|last6=Stoica|first6=Ion|date=2013-01-01|title=Shark: SQL and Rich Analytics at Scale|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2463676.2465288|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data|series=SIGMOD '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=13–24|doi=10.1145/2463676.2465288|isbn=9781450320375}}</ref>, created a system that was able to efficiently execute SQL and advanced analytics workloads at scale. Shark won Best Demo Award at [[SIGMOD]] 2012<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/news/shark-wins-best-demo-award-at-sigmod-2012/|title=Shark Wins Best Demo Award at SIGMOD 2012|website=AMPLab - UC Berkeley|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref>. Shark was one of the first open source interactive SQL on Hadoop systems, with claims that it was between 10 to 100 times faster than [[Apache Hive]]. Shark was used by technology companies such as Yahoo<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spark-summit.org/2013/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Tully-SparkSummit4.pdf|title=Analytics on Spark & Shark @Yahoo|last=Tully|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>, although it was replaced by a newer system called Spark SQL in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://databricks.com/blog/2014/07/01/shark-spark-sql-hive-on-spark-and-the-future-of-sql-on-spark.html|title=Shark, Spark SQL, Hive on Spark, and the future of SQL on Apache Spark|date=2014-07-01|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref>

The second research project, GraphX<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Joseph E.|last2=Xin|first2=Reynold S.|last3=Dave|first3=Ankur|last4=Crankshaw|first4=Daniel|last5=Franklin|first5=Michael J.|last6=Stoica|first6=Ion|date=2014-01-01|title=GraphX: Graph Processing in a Distributed Dataflow Framework|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2685048.2685096|journal=Proceedings of the 11th USENIX Conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation|series=OSDI'14|location=Berkeley, CA, USA|publisher=USENIX Association|pages=599–613|isbn=9781931971164}}</ref>, created a graph processing system on top of Spark, a general data-parallel system. GraphX at the same challenged the notion that specialized systems are necessary for graph computation. GraphX was released as an open source project and merged into Spark in 2014, as the graph processing library on Spark.

=== Databricks ===
In 2013, along with [[Matei Zaharia]] and other key Spark contributors, Xin co-founded [[Databricks]], a venture-backed company based in San Francisco that offers data platform as a service, based on Spark.

In 2014, Xin led a team of engineers from Databricks to compete in the Sort Benchmark and won the 2014 world record in Daytona GraySort using Spark, beating the previous record held by [[Apache Hadoop]] by 30 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/2014/10/startup-crunches-100-terabytes-data-record-23-minutes/|title=Startup Crunches 100 Terabytes of Data in a Record 23 Minutes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref> Xin claimed that Spark was the fastest open source engine for sorting a petabyte of data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://databricks.com/blog/2014/10/10/spark-petabyte-sort.html|title=Apache Spark the fastest open source engine for sorting a petabyte|date=2014-10-10|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref>

While at Databricks, he also started the DataFrame project<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://databricks.com/blog/2015/02/17/introducing-dataframes-in-spark-for-large-scale-data-science.html|title=Introducing DataFrames in Apache Spark for Large Scale Data Science|date=2015-02-17|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref> and Project Tungsten<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html|title=Project Tungsten: Bringing Apache Spark Closer to Bare Metal|date=2015-04-28|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref>. The former has become the foundational API while the later has become the new execution engine for Spark 2.0.
