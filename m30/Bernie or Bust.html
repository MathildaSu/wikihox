{{Bernie Sanders series}}
'''Bernie or Bust''' (also expressed with the [[hashtag]] '''#BernieorBust''') refers to the sentiment held by many [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|supporters]] of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] who do not plan to vote for Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] and who may be considering leaving the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] altogether.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/01/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-bernie-or-bust/index.html|title=Sanders supporters vow to hold out|last=Zeleny|first=Jeff|date=|website=CNN|publisher=|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref> The Bernie or Bust movement has been criticized by [[neoliberal]]s and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Stop Trump movement|other Trump opponents]] as aiding [[Donald Trump]] to win the election.

The Bernie or Bust movement generally stems from voter distrust of the Democratic Party establishment and the party's [[primary election|primary system]], long accusing the party of bias toward [[Hillary Clinton]] since about December 2015, culminating in [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|leaked emails]] just prior to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] (which potentially revealed bias against Sanders, seemingly confirming Sanders supporters' doubts).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/bernie-or-bust/|title=Bernie or Bust|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/dnc-emails-wikileaks-hillary-bernie-sanders|title=Leaked DNC emails reveal details of anti-Sanders sentiment|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2016|work=|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=|via=}}</ref> In an interview with [[CNN]], activist YanNe' Ndgo explained that the movement stems not as much from admiration for Sanders, but from distrust of Clinton, explaining "We don’t trust what she says and we don’t like what she’s done".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/26/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-voters/index.html|title=Sanders supporter says she's 'Bernie or bust'|last=Scott|first=Eugene|date=|website=CNN|publisher=|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref>

However, a poll by [[Quinnipiac University]] revealed that 75% of Sanders supporters during the primary election would in fact rally behind Clinton if she were to become the Democratic Party's nominee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} A McClatchy-Marist poll had similar findings, claiming that 1 in 4 Sanders supporters would not back Clinton.<ref name=":0" /> Sanders has repeatedly stated that he would vote for Clinton in the general election in order to avoid a "disastrous" Trump presidency and encourages his supporters to do the same, taking a position opposite of the Bernie or Bust movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-sanders-clinton-20160424-story.html|title=Voters' 'Bernie or Bust' efforts persist despite Sanders' vow not to be another Ralph Nader|last=|first=|date=|website=latimes.com|publisher=|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref>

On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton at a rally in New Hampshire, and while he has not formally ended his campaign the move has been seen as the final step towards doing so. The announcement saw many of the threats from voters to leave the party enacted, and has been seen by some as partly responsible for the rise in support for Green candidate [[Jill Stein]]'s [[Jill Stein presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign]], which had previously advertised itself as 'Plan B for Bernie'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zhenya-beck/political-climate-change-_b_11000346.html|title=Political Climate Change: Bernie Sander's Exit And The Rise Of The Greens' Jill Stein|last=Beck|first=Zhenya|last2=|date=July 15, 2016|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=|access-date=July 17, 2016|last3=|first3=|last4=|last5=|first5=}}</ref> 

In her speech during the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] urged other Sanders supporters to back Hillary Clinton and later said that Bernie or Bust people are "being ridiculous."<ref name = "Sarah Silverman" >{{cite news|date=July 24, 2016|title=Democratic National Convention live updates: 'You're being ridiculous,' Sarah Silverman tells Sanders die-hards|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-democratic-convention-2016-live-a-blunt-message-from-sarah-silverman-1469496266-htmlstory.html}}</ref>
