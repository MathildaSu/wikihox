'''Dream House For Medically Fragile Children''' is an organization dedicated to dramatically reducing the number of medically fragile children in foster care while improving the quality of life for these children and their families.

==History==
In the fall of 2001, Laura Moore founded The Dream House for Kids, Inc. as a non-profit organization dedicated to establishing the resources needed to get medically fragile children out of institutions.  The goal was to save these children from neglectful and abusive situations and give them the home, family and future they so desperately needed to live.  As the organization continued to grow and develop, the name was officially changed in December 2002 to Dream House For Medically Fragile Children, Inc. and the focus expanded to the metro Atlanta Area to create the community support and partnerships necessary to develop and organize the needed resources for hundreds more children and families.  Plans are currently underway to build a state-wide resource center in Conyers, Georgia to serve children and families from all over Georgia.
