47,XXY is a chromosomal arrangement where a person has 2 X chromosomes and 1 Y chromosome. The apparent majority of individuals with the XXY [[karyotype]] are males and some of those are considered to have [[Klinefelter Syndrome]]. However other individuals use estrogen and identify as female<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmid|first1=Michael|last2=Guttenbach|first2=Martina|last3=Enders|first3=Herbert|last4=Terruhn|first4=Volker|date=December 1992|title=A 47,XXY female with unusual genitalia|journal=Human Genetics|volume=90|issue=4|pages=346–349|doi=10.1007/BF00220456|pmid=1483688}}</ref> (some are born with a female phenotype and with SRY negative 47,XXY<ref name="Röttger 2000">{{cite journal|last1=Röttger|first1=Susanne|last2=Schiebel|first2=Katrin|last3=Senger|first3=Gabriele|last4=Ebner|first4=Susanne|last5=Schempp|first5=Werner|last6=Scherer|first6=Gerd|year=2000|title=An SRY-negative 47,XXY mother and daughter|journal=Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics|volume=91|issue=1–4|pages=204–207|doi=10.1159/000056845|pmid=11173857}}</ref>) and some 47,XXYs choose to be androgynous, possibly identifying as [[intersex]], and use no hormone treatment.<ref name="Diamond 2011">{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|date=April 2011|title=Developmental, sexual and reproductive neuroendocrinology: historical, clinical and ethical considerations (editorial)|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=255–263|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.003|pmid=21310174|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2011-ethical-considerations.html}}</ref> The choice of identification and hormonal or surgical treatments may follow gender identity counselling.<ref name="Parkinson 2007">{{cite journal|last=Parkinson|first=John|year=2007|title=Gender identity in Klinefelter’s syndrome and male hypogonadism: four cases of dysphoria (oral presentation abstract, 42nd RANZCP Congress, Gold Coast, Queensland, April 29–May 3, 2007)|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|volume=41|issue=Supplement 1|page=A70|doi=10.1080/14401614070410s10109|url=http://anp.sagepub.com/content/41/1_suppl/A70.1.extract}}</ref> It is not known what percentage of 47,XXYs identify as male, as female, or otherwise.<ref name="Diamond 2011"/>

== Gender Identities ==
There are three distinct gender categories of people who are XXY or a variant:

=== Male/ Klinefelter Syndrome ===
{{main|Klinefelter Syndrome}}
[[Klinefelter Syndrome]] is a clinical diagnosis that has a basis in extra genetic material in the form of an additional X chromosome.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Groth|first1=Kristian A.|last2=Skakkebæk|first2=Anne|last3=Høst|first3=Christian|last4=Gravholt|first4=Claus Højbjerg|last5=Bojesen|first5=Anders|date=January 2013|title=Clinical review: Klinefelter syndrome—a clinical update|journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=98|issue=1|pages=23–30|pmid=23118429|doi=10.1210/jc.2012-2382}}</ref> These individuals identify, or choose to identify, as men, take testosterone, and are, for all practical purposes, ordinary males. They may be challenged by development of breast tissue called [[gynecomastia]] for males and should learn to do breast self exams since they are at risk for breast cancer if they do not choose to have mastectomies.  They may or may not consider themselves to have [[Klinefelter Syndrome]] and may choose to go by XXY Males.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bock|first=Robert|date=August 1993|title=Understanding Klinefelter syndrome: a guide for XXY males and their families. NIH Pub. No. 93-3202|location=Bethesda, Md.|publisher=Office of Research Reporting, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|oclc=32523247|url=http://xxy.50megs.com/klinefel.htm}}</ref> Infertility is a concern for this group.

=== Non-binary ===

This group of XXY people often feel they are part male / part female, and usually pick one side of the binary of male or female gender. They may take hormone supplementation in the form of estrogen or testosterone as needed to avoid issues with a variety of medical problems (such as [[osteoporosis]]), which can affect people with low base hormone.  [[Intersex]] XXY people do not have [[Klinefelter Syndrome]]; possessing breasts is not a challenge to their gender identity and they are comfortable with their female phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Saavedra-Castillo|first1=Eloisa|last2=Cortés-Gutiérrez|first2=Elva I.|last3=Dávila-Rodríguez|first3=Martha I.|last4=Reyes-Martínez|first4=Maria Eugenia|last5=Oliveros-Rodríguez|first5=Amalia|date=February 2005|title=47,XXY female with testicular feminization and positive SRY: a case report|journal=Journal of Reproductive Medicine|volume=50|issue=2|pages=138–140|pmid=15755052}}</ref> Although, they should learn to do breast self exams since they might have a higher incidence of [[breast cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Coley|first1=Geoffrey M.|last2=Otis|first2=Richard D.|last3=Clark|first3=Willia E. II|date=June 1971|title=Multiple primary tumors including bilateral breast cancers in a man with Klinefelter's syndrome|journal=Cancer|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1476–1481|doi=10.1002/1097-0142(197106)27:6<1476::AID-CNCR2820270630>3.0.CO;2-T|pmid=4325988|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142(197106)27:6%3C1476::AID-CNCR2820270630%3E3.0.CO;2-T/pdf}}</ref>

=== Female ===

These individuals identify or choose to identify as women, take [[estradiol]], and are for all practical purposes ordinary females. Some of them can and have been documented as bearing children.<ref name="Röttger 2000"/> There is no syndrome for an XXY person who identifies female; their breasts, hips, and lack of masculine features are considered normal.<ref name="Parkinson 2007"/>

A very small number of XXYs not born with female genitalia actually go through the process to transition from male to female.  It would appear that more choose to adapt to the fluidity of their gender than to make a physical transition from one binary to the other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auer|first1=Matthias K.|last2=Fuss|first2=Johannes|last3=Stalla|first3=Guenter K.|last4=Athanasoulia|first4=Anastasia P.|date=October 2013|title=Twenty years of endocrinologic treatment in transsexualism: analyzing the role of chromosomal analysis and hormonal profiling in the diagnostic work-up|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=4|pages=1103–1110|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.05.047|pmid=23809495}}</ref>
