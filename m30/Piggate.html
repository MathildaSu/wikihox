The '''"Piggate"''' scandal in the United Kingdom concerns the allegations made by [[Michael Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]] in his book about UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]].

In mid-to-late September of 2015, prior to the release of Lord Ashcroft's book, it sprung up that the book contains details on David Cameron's alleged use of drugs during his university days, as well as information that there is photographic evidence of an incident in which David Cameron, as part of an initiation ceremony, put a private part of his anatomy into a dead pig's mouth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/david-cameron-pig-head-lord-ashcroft-unofficial-biography-drug-taking-claims|title=Cameron biography: Ashcroft makes new debauchery claims about student days|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11879859/David-Cameron-claims-Five-things-you-need-to-know.html|title=David Cameron claims: Five things you need to know|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron-piggate-allegations-pm-will-not-dignify-claims-he-put-genitals-in-pigs-mouth-31545768.html|title=David Cameron 'piggate' allegations: PM 'will not dignify' claims he put genitals in pig's mouth|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morleyobserver.co.uk/news/local/piggate-conservative-association-cancels-planned-pig-racing-night-1-7472774|title=#Piggate- Conservative association cancels planned pig racing night|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/21/heres-how-politicians-reacted-to-david-camerons-piggate-5400688/|title=Here’s how politicians reacted to David Cameron’s #piggate|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/09/21/david-cameron-piggate-claim/72551554/|title=Twitter lampoons David Cameron over #piggate claim|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>

When the allegations of the incident were mentioned by a caller on [[The Wright Stuff]], [[Matthew Wright]]'s television chat show that discusses daily matters with regular people, the caller was cut off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/21/matthew-wright-david-cameron-pig-gate-allegations-shuts-down-caller_n_8169320.html|title=Matthew Wright Brutally Shuts Down Caller Mentioning David Cameron #PigGate Allegations|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>
