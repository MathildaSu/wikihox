== History ==
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor-entrepreneur Victor Shear. Shear's vision was to revolutionize electronic commerce by creating technologies that allowed independent actors to establish trust between each other when using digital networks and devices. Shear, a sociologist by training, brought concepts from human behavior, community construction, commerce and economics to life in the digital world in a unique way. The concepts that Intertrust has developed over the years cross disciplines and impact everything requiring trusted transactions, from healthcare, enterprise computing to entertainment and consumer electronics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/30/334583/index.htm|title=Can This Man Bring Down Microsoft?

== Products ==
Intertrust has developed and invested in several products. 

=== ExpressPlay ===
ExpressPlay is a cloud DRM system that provides content protection that meets standards set by Hollywood film studios. Its multi-DRM technology is available across most modern platforms and formats. ExpressPlay consists of three main parts: a multi DRM cloud service, a binary SDK, and packaging tools. The binary SDK can be implemented in order to use [[Marlin (DRM)|Marlin DRM]] on operating systems such as iOS, Android, Windows, and MacOS. ExpressPlay uses other Intertrust products such as Seacert and whiteCryption for key provisioning and to [[Hardening (computing)|harden]] its SDK. 

=== Seacert ===
Seacert provides [[Public key infrastructure|Public Key Infrastructure]] (PKI) services, offering customized trust service to companies that need digital certificates, identities and cryptographic keys as part of their trusted infrastructure. The product supports a variety of cryptographic standards and protocols provides customizable implementations. Seacert provides device and application provisioning that authenticates legitimate devices and applications, granting them access to data repositories, network applications, and databases based on either a specific device, downloadable application or a unique user identity to which multiple devices or downloadable applications are linked. It also provides secure service provisioning by certifying the private keys that services generate.

=== whiteCryption ===
whiteCryption's software security toolkit Cryptanium is cross-platform toolkit that protects software applications, mobile apps and IoT devices. This guards these against reverse engineering, tampering and unwanted modifications. It consists of two parts: a code protection application suite and a secure key box. The code protection software suite is a tool used to “harden” software application at source code level to prevent reverse engineering and other techniques used by cybercriminals who want to gain access to sensitive information and resources contained in applications. The secure key box is a white-box cryptographic library that implements a number of standard cryptographic algorithms in a way that hides secret keys at rest and during runtime.

=== Personagraph ===
Personagraph is a data-driven private market exchange for app publishers and advertisers. It consists of two parts: PG Edge a first-party data processing and management platform, and PG Axis, an integrated data programmatic RTB stack that is connected to PG Edge to help publishers monetize their audiences. 

=== Genecloud ===
Genecloud is a genomic data platform that allows scientists and researchers to collaborate on analyzing genomic data in a secure environment while respecting privacy. 

=== The Intertrust Platform ===
The Intertrust Platform will allow organizations to build their own secure data platform by picking and choosing capabilities of the other Intertrust products.
