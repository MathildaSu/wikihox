== History ==

The company was co-founded by Manoj Gupta, a venture capitalist, and Monica Gupta in 2011 with funding from India-based Nexus Venture Partners and US-based Lightspeed Venture Partners. The startup was launched with 80 employees and five offices across India. By 2012, the startup completely exhausted the Rs10 crore series-A round of funding, following which it downsized to a 10-member team and continued operations out of a one-room office.

In April 2015, Craftsvilla raised $18 million in a series B round of funding from Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, Global Founders Capital and Apoletto. In November, the startup raised another $34 million in series C funding from the same investors. Following this fresh round of investments, the startup claimed to have seen a 10% month on month growth and hired close to 200 people.
