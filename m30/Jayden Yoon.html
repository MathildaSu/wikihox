==Early life==
Yoon's passion for art began while he was attending kindergarten, his teacher spotted his talent and suggested that he participated in an art competition. He ended up winning to the shock of parents, who then began encouraging him to take various art lessons to further his talent. Despite the various lessons, Yoon felt that his talent was being underestimated and decided to improve on his own. After that, Yoon participated in hundreds of art competitions, both local and international and won most of them. In addition to his talent for art, Yoon also discovered that he has multiple other talents including acting, computers, graphic design, songwriting, singing, dancing and beat-boxing.<ref>{{cite web|title=JAYDEN YOON'S FAN PAGE|url=http://jyzk.wordpress.com/faq-about-jayden-yoon/|accessdate=28 July 2014}}{{verify credibility|date=July 2014}}</ref>

Yoon’s parents had always loved listening to classical music and he was often exposed to it as a child. His family encouraged singing, which Jayden loved doing from a young age. Yoon’s interest in piano sparked at the age of nine when his older brothers begun having piano lessons at home. Noticing his interest his older brothers taught him how to play [[Für Elise]] on the piano and quickly realised he was a natural. Today Yoon sings and composes his own music using the piano. Noticing his talent his mother entered him into the Vilma Tampus Piano Competition. Yoon was up against children who had been playing for years, while Yoon had no music sheets and had never taken any proper piano lessons. He ended up winning the competition and that  encouraged him to pursue his talent even more. Yoon has hundreds of self-produced music tracks and wishes to have them recorded by established recording companies in the near future.<ref>{{cite news|title=Count on MCA, says Ong|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx/?file=%2F2007%2F7%2F22%2Fnation%2F18375492&sec=nation|accessdate=28 July 2014|publisher=The Star Online|date=July 22, 2007}} {{failed verification|date=July 2014}}</ref>
