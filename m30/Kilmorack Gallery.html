'''Kilmorack Gallery''' was established in 1997 in a disused church in rural [[Inverness-shire]], [[Scotland]]. Its founder [[Tony Davidson]] believed that inspirational art could sit in an inspirational building just as well as in a white cube. Kilmorack Gallery is now one of Scotlandâ€™s most northerly private art galleries of such a nationally recognized high standard. 

Artists showcased include established and emerging Scottish painters and sculptors. These include Eduard Bersudsky [[Sharmanka Kinetic Gallery]], Eoghan Bridge, [[Laurence Broderick]], [[Joyce W. Cairns]], Kirstie Cohen, [[Helen Denerley]], [[Steve Dilworth]], [[Lotte Glob]], [[Janette Kerr]], [[Alan Macdonald]], Peter White and [[George Wyllie]].

The Church of Scotland kirk building was built in 1786, recast in 1835, and lay empty for twenty-fire years before finding its new use as an art gallery. This reuse is often cited as one of the more fitting church adaptation.
