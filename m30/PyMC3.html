'''PyMC3'''<ref>Salvatier J, Wiecki TV, Fonnesbeck C. (2016) Probabilistic programming in Python using PyMC3. PeerJ Computer Science 2:e55 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.55</ref> is a [[Python_(programming_language) | Python]] package for Bayesian statistical modeling and probabilistic machine learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms. PyMC3 relies on [[Theano (software) | Theano]] for automatic differentiation and also for computation optimization and dynamic C compilation. 
PyMC3 is an [[ Open-source_software | open source]] project, developed by the community and fiscally sponsored by [http://www.numfocus.org/open-source-projects.html NumFocus].

== Inference engines ==
PyMC3 implements non-gradient-based and gradient-based [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference and stochastic, gradient-based [[variational Bayesian methods]] for approximate Bayesian inference.
