'''Kris McCaddon''' was the original guitarist for the [[Metalcore]] band, [[Society's Finest]] and lead guitarist for [[Demon Hunter]]. He was also the vocalist for the bands, [[Embodyment]] and [[The Famine]].

==History==

McCaddon's career started in 1994 when he started the band [[Embodyment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/embodyment-mn0000151675/biography|title=Embodyment biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|first=Mike|last=DaRonco|accessdate= April 9, 2016}}</ref> They released their debut album, ''Embrace the Eternal'', in 1997; it featured guest vocals by [[Living Sacrifice]] vocalist [[Bruce Fitzhugh]]. ''Embrace the Eternal'' would later be re-released by their record label, [[Solid State Records]]. He left the band in 2000 before recording their second album, ''[[The Narrow Scope of Things]]''. McCaddon started the band, along with [[Joshua Ashworth]], Rob Pruett, [[Joel Bailey (musician)|Joel Bailey]], and [[Mindrage|Chad Wilburn]], [[Society's Finest]]. In 2000 they released an [[EP]] titled ''Private Conflicts & Suicides''. Their debut album, ''[[The Journey...So Far]]'', was released on Solid State Records in May 2000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/societys_finest-journey_so_far | title=Society's Finest – ''The Journey So Far'' | work=[[Exclaim!]] | date=September 1, 2000 | accessdate=April 9, 2016 | author=Gramlich, Chris}}</ref> In 2003 they took a short break, during which  McCaddon decided to leave Society's Finest, and went on to join [[Demon Hunter]]. After leaving [[Society's Finest]] and [[Embodyment]], [[Ryan Clark (musician)|Ryan Clark]] and [[Don Clark (musician)|Don Clark]], formerly of [[Training for Utopia]], recruited him, [[Jesse Sprinkle]], formerly of [[Poor Old Lu]], and [[Jon Dunn (musician)|Jon Dunn]] (Who would later join [[Soul Embraced]]) to join their project, [[Demon Hunter]]. Demon Hunter already had an album before he joined. On this [[Demon Hunter (album)|album]] McCaddon had contributed by photography. On his Demon Hunter debut, ''[[Summer of Darkness]]'', was great success. In 2005, [[Ethan Luck]], formerly of [[The O.C. Supertones]] and [[Project 86]], replaced McCaddon. In 2006, former Embodyment members, Mark Garza (drums) and Andrew Godwin (guitar), contacted McCaddon and said they wanted to play metal again. McCaddon contacted former Society's Finest member, Nick Nowell (bass) and asked him to join their new project, [[The Famine]]. In 2007, they signed to [[Solid State Records]] and released their debut [[EP]], ''The Famine''. In 2008, they released their debut album, ''The Raven and the Reaping''. In 2010, McCaddon departed The Famine and Nick Nowell took over vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2010/01/09/news/the-famine-replace-vocalist/ |title=The Famine Replace Vocalist &#124; Theprp.com – Metal, Hardcore And Rock News, Reviews And More |publisher=Theprp.com |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> The Famine later broke-up in 2011.
