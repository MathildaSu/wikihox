== Biography ==
<ref>http://www.mtv.com/artists/alex-young/</ref>
Pop-phenomena Alex Young started out as a regular on [[Sesame Street]], and then shocked the music scene with the release of her debut album “Amazing.”

Musical Director on [[Lady Gaga]]’s world tour, Kern Brantley had this to say about the pop sensation. “As a musical director, I have been fortunate to work with some of the top female artists in the world such as [[Beyonce]], Lady Gaga, [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Aaliyah]], Monica, and [[Faith Evans]] just to name a few. Upon meeting and working with Alex Young, all I can say is here we go again! Alex is the next generation of modern music.”

Alex has proven that she is a true entertainer. Her powerful presence exploded onstage with her opening for [[Cee Lo Green]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPAvk0n6S7Y</ref> at the [[Mahaffey Theater]] in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she unveiled her 2012 club show. Alex was featured as an opening act on July 26th at the WBLS Summer Stage show in New York City as part of her summer tour. She is also currently working on her next album. “I’m really excited about the new direction I’m pushing for my album. A funky electro-pop sound that’s gonna make you wanna jump up and do that dance!”

Alex’s love of music and strong work ethic, coupled with A-list production teams and choreography is a proven formula for success. In addition to her new music, she is also focusing her time on her new fashion line, “A Young Rose”, which she launched as a participating e-tailer at Fashions Night Out during [[New York Fashion Week]].This created a great “buzz” as the blogs were calling her one of the top ten best dressed at the tents.

Today, Alex Young fills a whole new lane in the world of [[music]], [[arts]] and [[entertainment]].
