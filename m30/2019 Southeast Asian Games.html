===Host selection===
On July 18, 2012, Brunei was selected to host the 30th Southeast Asian Games. This was the second time that Brunei will host the Games, the first and only of which was the [[1999 Southeast Asian Games|1999 edition]] wherein they place seventh overall. The country was slated to host the [[2017 Southeast Asian Games|2017 edition]] but the Sultanate wanted to host this Games instead of the former.<ref name="Brunei Host"/> Brunei plans to upgrade its sports facilities and build a new national stadium in Salambigar to accommodate the Games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2014/03/21/brunei-ready-host-2019-sea-games | title=Brunei ready to host 2019 SEA Games | publisher=''[[The Brunei Times]]'' | date=March 21, 2014 | accessdate=June 7, 2015 | author=Quratul-ain Bandial}}</ref>

However, on June 4, 2015, Brunei withdrew its hosting rights at the meeting in the [[Southeast Asian Games Federation| Southeast Asian Games Federation Council]] after the said country's [[Cabinet of Brunei|Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports]] had failed to give support for the said Games. The withdrawal of Brunei's hosting rights were also due to the country's lack of sporting facilities, accommodation, and preparation of their athletes.<ref name="Brunei Withdraws"/>

With Brunei's withdrawal, the Philippines had expressed its interest to host the Games; the Philippines last hosted the Games in the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 edition]] where they emerged as the overall champion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/philippines/95430-ph-host-2019-sea-games-brunei | title=Philippines may host 2019 SEA Games as Brunei withdraws | publisher=''[[Rappler]]'' | work=[[Agence France-Presse]] | date=June 5, 2015 | accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref> They are also slated to host the 2025 edition.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/499162/sports/othersports/philippines-eyes-hosting-2019-sea-games-after-brunei-backs-out | title=Philippines eyes hosting 2019 SEA Games after Brunei backs out | publisher=''[[GMA News]]'' | date=June 5, 2015 | accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref> On the other hand, Thailand had also expressed its interest to host the games. Gen Yutthasak Sasipraba, President of the [[National Olympic Committee of Thailand]], had talks with three senior executives from the Philippines about their doubts of their country to host the Games; Thailand last hosted the Games in [[2007 Southeast Asian Games|2007]], placing as the champion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/584081/thailand-aims-to-rescue-2019-games | title=Thailand aims to rescue 2019 Games | publisher=''[[Bangkok Post]]'' | date=June 6, 2015 | accessdate=June 7, 2015 | author=Kittipong Thongsombat}}</ref> [[Vietnam]], the 2021 Southeast Asian Games host, was also offered to host this edition, but declined.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mb.com.ph/ph-to-host-2019-sea-games-after-brunei-vietnam-decline/ | title=PH to host 2019 SEA Games after Brunei, Vietnam decline | publisher=''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' | date=July 12, 2015 | accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

On July 10, 2015, the [[Philippine Olympic Committee]] announced that the Philippines will be hosting the Games and it will be held in [[Manila]].<ref name="Venues">{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/philippines/99035-philippines-host-2019-sea-games | title=Philippines set to host 2019 SEA Games | publisher=''[[Rappler]]'' | date=July 11, 2015 | accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> 

===Venues===
The [[Philippine Sports Commission]], instead of building new facilities, is planning to use existing venues and tapping the use of private facilities such as the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] in [[Pasay City]] and the [[Philippine Arena]] in [[Ciudad de Victoria]], [[Bulacan]].<ref name="Venues"/>
