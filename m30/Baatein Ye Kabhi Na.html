== Critical reception ==
[[File:Palak Muchhal.jpg|upright=1.0|thumb|right|Muchhal's rendition of the song was particularly praised by [[Music journalism|music critics]].]]
The song garnered mostly positive response from [[Music journalism|music critics]], most of them picking the female version as the better track in comparison.

''[[Bollywood Hungama]]'''s Rajiv Vijayakar calling the song "very consummate", appraised the "lovely tune" by [[Jeet Gannguli]], "emotional singing" by [[Arijit Singh]] and lyrics by [[Sayeed Quadri]]; "The mukhda is magical in its simplicity and the simple antaras are also riveting". Though Vijayakar felt that [[Palak Muchhal]]'s vocals delivery is "sweet" in the female version, it is not as "soulful" as the demand of the composition. He further opined that a "more experienced and unfettered singer like [[Shreya Ghoshal]]", would do justice for the song.<ref name=bh>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/musiccriticreview/id/742666 |title=Khamoshiyan (2015) Music Review |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |author=Rajiv Vijayakar |date=17 January 2015 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}{{Rating|3|5}}</ref> Kasmin Fernandes of ''[[The Times of India]]'', calling the track "a heart-rending ditty", found both the version "equally lilting".<ref name=toi>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/music-reviews/Khamoshiyan/articleshow/45809819.cms |title=Khamoshiyan – Music Review |work=[[The Times of India]] |author=Kasmin Fernandes |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}{{Rating|3.5|5}}</ref> 

Writing from ''[[Koimoi]]'', Surabhi Redkar commented; "The lyrics are good and in spite of its monotonous musical arrangements it completely hooks you to it. Also with a singer like Arijit Singh at hand, one can truly create wonders and so somehow the song does turn out to be a saviour". Calling the composition by Gannguli as "one of the best tracks from the album", Redkar affirmed that the female version is "much better" since Muchhal "completely feels the song and her vocals have the quality to make this romantic track a hit".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-movies/music-reviews/khamoshiyan-music-review/ |title=Khamoshiyan Music Review  |work=[[Koimoi]] |author=Surabhi Redkar |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}{{Rating|4|5}}</ref> R.M. Vijayakar from ''[[India West]]'', stated; "[The track] is intrinsically the best of an all-good lot".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiawest.com/entertainment/bollywood/movie_reviews/khamoshiyan-movie-review-when-intense-and-scary-turns-ridiculous/article_549cd0a8-a8ac-11e4-aa33-378deac11484.html |title='Khamoshiyan' Movie Review: When Intense and Scary Turns Ridiculous |work=[[India West]] |author=R.M. Vijayakar |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}{{Rating|2.5|5}}</ref> 

Sankhayan Ghosh from ''[[The Indian Express]]'', felt that Singh's rendition in the song sounds as "he's on autopilot". Regarding the music by Gannguli, Ghosh justified that, "there is little Arijit can do, when the tunes themselves are so worn out".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/play/beat-box-tunes-from-a-recycle-bin/ |title='Khamoshiyan' music album: Most of the songs are redundant and insipid |work=[[The Indian Express]] |author=Sankhayan Ghosh |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}{{Rating|2|5}}</ref> According to Joginder Tuteja of ''[[Rediff.com]]'', the song reminds him of one of the songs in ''[[Aashiqui 2]]'' (2013), with its "theme of love, separation and longing". He thought that both the versions will be enjoyed by those who "love old fashioned [[Bollywood]] melodies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/music-review-khamoshiyan-is-a-good-listen/20150110.htm |title=Music Review: Khamoshiyan is a good listen |work=[[Rediff.com]] |author=Joginder Tuteja |date=10 January 2015 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}{{Rating|3|5}}</ref>
