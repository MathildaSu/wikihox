The following is a list of U.S.-based organizations classified by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) as [[hate group]]s.<ref name=hatemap>{{cite web|title=Hate Map|work=Southern Poverty Law Center website|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=December 7, 2015|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map}}</ref> The SPLC defines ''hate groups'' as those that "... have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their [[wikt:immutable|immutable]] characteristics."<ref name=hatemap/> The SPLC states: "Hate group activities can include criminal acts, marches, rallies, speeches, meetings, leafleting or publishing." The SPLC adds that "Listing here does not imply a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity".<ref name="hatemap"/>
Since 1981, the SPLC's Intelligence Project has published a quarterly ''[[Intelligence Report]]'' that monitors what the SPLC considers [[hate group]]s in the United States.<ref name=intelligencereport>{{cite web|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|work=Southern Poverty Law Center website|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intelligence-report|title=Intelligence Report|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}</ref>

Apart from the listed groups themselves, the SPLC's hate group listings have been criticized by some political observers and prominent Republicans.

[[White nationalism]] is a [[political ideology]] that advocates a [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racial]] definition of [[national identity]] for [[white people]] (as opposed to [[multiculturalism]]) and a separate all-white [[nation state]].

[[Black separatism]] is a movement which historically sought to create separate institutions for black people, mostly of African descent, in societies historically dominated by whites. Some also have traditionally sought out a separate homeland. Some [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] groups, most notably the [[Nation of Islam]] and the [[New Black Panther Party]], seek less to create their own land than to co-opt existing power structures, they have preached hatred of white people and support or condone violent actions by its core constituencies.<ref name=randorg>[https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P4118.pdf Publications], rand.org; accessed March 30, 2016.</ref>

''[[Neo-Confederate]]'' is a term used by academics to describe the views of various groups and individuals who have a positive belief system concerning the historical experience of the [[Confederate States of America]], the southern secession, and the southern United States — including [[proslavery]] ideology. Neo-Confederacy usually expresses veneration for Confederate leaders, soldiers, writers, symbols and other aspects of the Confederacy.<ref name="vastpublicindifference.blogspot.com">[http://vastpublicindifference.blogspot.com/2008/05/confederate-monumental-landscape_26.html Confederate Monumental Landscape], vastpublicindifference.blogspot.com; accessed March 30, 2016.</ref>

It advocates alternative interpretations of [[History of the United States|American history]], particularly regarding the [[American Civil War]], the [[history of the Southern United States]] and  the [[History of the United States (1776–1789)|founding of the United States]]. It portrays the southern United States as victims of war crimes and constitutional violations by [[Abraham Lincoln]], the [[Northern United States]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plpow.com/WhyTheWarWasStarted.htm#Thomas_DiLorenzo|title=The Lincoln Myth by Thomas DiLorenzo|publisher=Plpow.com|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}</ref>

* "Before discussing how Holocaust denial constitutes a conspiracy theory, and how the theory is distinctly American, it is important to understand what is meant by the term "Holocaust denial." Holocaust deniers, or "revisionists," as they call themselves, question all three major points of definition of the Nazi Holocaust. First, they contend that, while mass murders of Jews did occur (although they dispute both the intentionality of such murders as well as the supposed deservedness of these killings), there was no official Nazi policy to murder Jews. Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1&nbsp;million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers. And third, Holocaust deniers contend that the death toll of European Jews during World War II was well below 6&nbsp;million. Deniers float numbers anywhere between 300,000 and 1.5&nbsp;million, as a general rule." Mathis, Andrew E.

These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about an historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a reexamination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a "certain body of irrefutable evidence" or a "convergence of evidence" that suggest that an event_like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust—did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer & Grobman 200:34).

It is not intended as a polemic, nor does it attempt to ascribe motives. Rather, it seeks to explain the fundamental error in the "revisionist" approach, as well as why that approach of necessity leaves no other choice. It concludes that "revisionism" is a misnomer because the facts do not accord with the position it puts forward and, more importantly, its methodology reverses the appropriate approach to historical investigation... "Revisionism" is obliged to deviate from the standard methodology of historical pursuit, because it seeks to mold facts to fit a preconceived result; it denies events that have been objectively and empirically proved to have occurred; and because it works backward from the conclusion to the facts, thus necessitating the distortion and manipulation of those facts where they differ from the preordained conclusion (which they almost always do).

The term 'revisionist' permeates their publications as descriptive of their motives, orientation and methodology. In fact, Holocaust denial is in no sense 'revisionism', it is denial...

Thus the deniers link themselves to a specific historiographic tradition of reevaluating the past. Claiming the mantle of the World War I revisionists and denying they have any objective other than the dissemination of the truth constitute a tactical attempt to acquire an intellectual credibility that would otherwise elude them."
