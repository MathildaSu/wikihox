'''LaMar's Donuts''' is a [[restaurant chain|chain]] of gourmet doughnut (Donut) bistros founded in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and headquartered in [[Denver, Colorado]].<ref>http://www.lamars.com/contact-us/</ref> LaMar's has 25 stores in five states—, ([[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], and [[Nebraska]])—and plans to expand to others.  
LaMar’s Donuts has won newspaper readers' poll awards for best doughnuts in several of the cities where they have stores. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} According to the LaMar's website, the famed [[Zagat Survey]], the [[New York City]]-based namer of premier dining spots nationwide, described LaMar's Donuts as "extraordinary; fit for kings".

* Founder Ray LaMar opened a donut shop in [[Midtown Kansas City]]. Ray opened the shop in an old Gas Station on [[Linwood Boulevard]] east of Main. He made the donuts homemade, mixing the dough and rolling, and then cutting. Then he would deep-fry them.  LaMar's still makes all of the donuts the same way by hand and fresh every day. The shop was open from then until May 2005. 
* It moved from the old gas station to a nice building a block over from the original. [[Jay Leno]] dubbed Ray the King of Donuts.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
