The '''D.C. United Academy''' is the [[youth system#Youth academies|youth and development]] program for the [[Major League Soccer]] club [[D.C. United]]. The program consists of four levels: the [[D.C. United U-23|under-23]] and [[D.C. United U-20|under-20]] teams, as well as the Academy (U-18/17 & U-16/15) and Pre-Academy teams (U-14, U-13). While the U-23 team plays in the fourth tier, [[USL Premier Development League]], the U-20 team plays in the [[Super-20 League]], and the Academy and Pre-Academy teams play in the [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]] leagues.

== History ==
[[File:DCU Academy v Triangle FC 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The U-16 team playing Triangle F.C. in the 2006 Super Y League semifinals.]]

The D.C. United Academy was created in 2005 in an effort to provide local talent an opportunity to have professional training. The D.C. United Academy has been one of the most successful MLS academies. Many players have been signed directly from the Academy to the professional team, or have gone to college and later played professionally.

Like most [[Major League Soccer]] teams, United's academy features youth pre-academy teams that ascend to the ranks of the senior team on the professional level. Starting in 2016, United will field their reserve team in the third-division [[United Soccer League]]. Beneath their reserve and senior squads is the [[D.C. United U-23|under-23]] side, whom play in the [[USL Premier Development League|Premier Development League]].

The teenage brackets represent the main academy as well as the pre-academy structure. Players from the under-15 to the under-18 age level play in the [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]] league, playing against other academy teams around the nation. Unlike most soccer leagues in the U.S., the USSDA academy league runs on a winter-based schedule, with the season going from August until June.

Consisting of players aged from under-12 to under-14, the Pre-Academy is a stepping stone for younger players to adapt to an academy setting. This age group of players participates in Northeast Pre-Academy League.<ref name="u11 u13 program information">{{cite web|title=U–11 & U–13 Training Program: About the Program|url=http://www.dcunited.com/camps/2010/u11-u13-training-program?utm_source=U11-U13+Training+Program&utm_medium=Secondary&utm_campaign=Navigation|work=[[D.C. United]]|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>

For players at the U-10 level and below, United offers speciality training camps.

== Reserves ==

From 2005 until 2012, D.C. United fielded a reserve team that played in the [[MLS Reserve Division]]. The reserve team disbanded when Major League Soccer and USL Pro announced a player development partnership, and United announced [[Richmond Kickers]] as their USL Pro affiliate.<ref name=affiliation>{{cite web|title=D.C.
