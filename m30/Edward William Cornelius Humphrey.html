==Presbyterian elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly==

Judge Humphrey, a Presbyterian Church Elder from Louisville, was appointed by the [[Presbyterian General Assembly]] to serve on a national committee which met in [[Philadelphia]] on February 5. 1902, to consider creed revision. He was selected as the only lay member of a sub-committee composed of himself and five ordained Presbyterian ministers, namely the General Assembly moderator Rev. Dr. Minton of San Francisco, Rev. D. W. Moffat of Fort Wayne, Indiana, Rev. S. J. Nichols, Rev. D. W. Fisher, and Rev. William McKibben.  The group of six was charged with preparing the statement for changes to be presented to the General Assembly the following May in New York. The ''Fort Wayne Sentinel'' reported, "Final action, it is expected, will also be taken on the questions of a brief statement from Presbyterian doctrine and a declaratory statement concerning debatable points in the confession of faith."<ref>The Fort Wayne Sentinel (Fort Wayne, Indiana), 5 Feb 1902, Page 1.</ref><ref>''REVISION TO BE DISCUSSED TO-DAY, Presbyterians Will Take Up Question at Morning Session Today, Admission is by ticket'' The Times (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),23 May 1901, Page 7. http://www.newspapers.com/clip/1629330/reverend_ec_humphrey_of_louisville_at/</ref>
