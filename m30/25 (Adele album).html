'''''25''''' is the upcoming third [[studio album]] by [[British people|British]] recording artist, [[singer-songwriter]] [[Adele]], tentatively scheduled to be released in 2014 by [[Universal Music Group]], [[XL Recordings]] and [[Columbia Records]]. It is the highly anticipated follow-up album to [[21 (Adele album)|21]], Adele's last successful album. In the August 2011 issue of Q Magazine, Adele revealed that she has written seven songs for her third studio album, which she promised would be more intimate and stripped-down than her first two albums [[19 (Adele album)|19]] and [[21 (Adele album)|21]].

== Background and development ==

Like her first two albums, [[19 (Adele album)|19]] and [[21 (Adele album)|21]], the album was expected to be titled after her age. It was heavily speculated to be called 23, 24, 25, or 26.  In June 2013, Adele showed off a new tattoo on her left hand saying "Paradise". This caused some guess that it may be making reference to a future music release, whether as a song or as an album.<ref>http://perezhilton.com/2013-06-28-adele-new-tattoo-bang-bang-new-york-city/?from=readmore_perezhilton&more=yes#more-385228</ref> In honor of her birthday the next day, Adele Tweeted on May 4, 2014 (although it was already her birthday, May 5, in the UK) "Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year x", confirming that the album would be titled 25.<ref>https://twitter.com/OfficialAdele/status/463067207384461312</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/31/10-most-anticipated-albums-this-autumn-adele-nicki-minaj|title=The 10 most anticipated albums this autumn|publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' (UK)|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref> Despite Adele's hint at the album title, music industry insider Paul Moss stated that the album had been registered without a title. 
Adele has admitted that she is willing to make sure that the album is "good enough" before releasing it, which is one of the main reasons why she is not rushing the release of the album. She previously stated that the album may contain other musical genres, such as country and bluegrass.

== Recording ==

The album was to be released in May 2012,<ref>http://popcrush.com/adele-third-album-may-2012/</ref> although this was postponed due to Adele's recovery from her ongoing vocal illness. Despite no album being released, Adele instead released "Skyfall" from the film of the same name in October 2012. Although Adele herself had never openly stated this, her manager, Jonathan Dickins stated that the record following 21 will be released when "the time is right"<ref>http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a340563/adele-in-no-hurry-to-make-third-album.html</ref>
In April 2013, a report suggested that Adele was in the studio working on her third album, and an even more recent report confirmed that Adele began work on her third album on April 22, 2013 and plans to release the album in mid-2014, It was further stated that Adele had written four songs and would be in total "lockdown mode" for the next couple weeks while she wrote and recorded the album in London and Los Angeles; this would also contradict the previous statement that would suggest she had seven songs written for the album. It was later reported that she had at least four songs done for the album, which would go back to her modern jazz roots, and was beginning to record the vocals.<ref>http://www.mstarz.com/articles/14968/20130622/adele-baby-boy-pictures-angelo-photos-skyfall-singer-working-on-new-album-in-2013.htm</ref> As of October 2013, the album is being worked on (as confirmed by Ryan Tedder), although everyone involved in the project is supposed to remain silent about it.

== Release ==

In April 2013, it was reported that Adele had gone back into the studio with plans to release the album in mid-2014, with four songs already done. According to the rumor, Adele plans to write and record the album in London and Los Angeles, and might be working with previous collaborator [[Paul Epworth]].<ref>http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-26-adele-drop-new-album-mid-2014-report</ref> Adele hinted in May 2014 that she would be releasing 25 later on in the year. Paul Moss later revealed via Twitter that the album could be released from any period up until June 2015, although it is more likely at the moment that the album will be released in January 2015 with the lead single being released at some point in 2014 if all goes as planned. One of Moss's Tweets containing the album's supposed registration code also suggested not only that the album would be released in between 2014 and 2015, but also that the lead single from the album would be released in October.
In July 2014, the World Music Awards Tweeted that Adele would be surprise-releasing a new album titled 25 soon with a 2015 tour to follow. These claims were denied by Chairman Martin Mills of Beggars Group, the parent company to Adele's label XL Recordings.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6157708/adele-next-album-rumor</ref> This is not the first time a surprise release has been suggested, as the Chairman of Adele's US record distributor, [[Columbia Records]], denied a "sneak attack" release after being directly asked whether or not she would follow in labelmate [[Beyoncé]]'s surprise release technique.

== Promotion ==

In an interview after [[Golden Globe Award|the Golden Globe Awards]], Adele confirmed plans to tour in the US when her next album was out, being that she had to cancel the remainder of her previous tour, the Adele Live tour.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1uZ4k7bW1A</ref> In a letter to one of her fans, Adele also confirmed plans to tour in Brazil when her next album is out; many fans interpreted this as a hint towards a world tour.<ref>http://dayoneadelefans.com/adele/adele-confirms-tour-to-brazil-in-letter-to-devoted-fan/</ref>
