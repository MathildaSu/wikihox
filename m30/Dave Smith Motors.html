==History==

===Dealership Starts in Wallace Idaho===
Dave Smith Motors started in 1965 in [[Wallace, Idaho]], when Dave Smith began selling Chevrolets to miners and smelter workers in northern Idaho’s [[Silver Valley, Idaho|Silver Valley]]. Five years later he moved the dealership to [[Kellogg, Idaho]]. Today Dave Smith Motors carries [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]] vehicles. The lineup of new vehicles at Dave Smith Motors includes [[Chevrolet]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Buick]], [[Cadillac]], [[Chrysler]], [[Dodge]], [[Jeep]], and [[Ram Trucks]].

===Idaho’s Silver Valley===
Idaho’s Silver Valley was born in the 1800s silver boom and is one of the richest [[silver mining]] regions in the world. The community is located along [[Interstate 90]] in northern Idaho’s [[Shoshone County]].  The valley thrived for decades as one of the nation’s greatest mining regions. Then in 1981 the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg closed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Preusch|first=Matthew|title=A Mining Town With a Bleak Past Starts to Blossom|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/travel/escapes/18havens.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 June 2013|date=January 2008}}</ref> Over 2,000 jobs left with the mine sending the area into an economic downturn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bunker Hill Mining Company Records, 1887-1984|url=http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/Manuscripts/mg367.htm|work=The records of the Bunker Hill Mining Company were donated to the University of Idaho Library by the company in June 1991. They were processed by Judith Nielsen between October 1993 and October 1994.|publisher=University of Idaho|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> The region also lost a lot of jobs in the timber industry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritter Saunders|first=Emilie|title=Car Sales Are Big Business in One Rural Idaho County|url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/idaho/2012/02/15/car-sales-are-big-business-in-one-rural-idaho-county/|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=StateImpact|date=February 12, 2012}}</ref> The population of the valley plummeted and car dealerships were losing the battle to stay in business. Dave Smith nearly lost the dealership.

===Hassle Free Buying===
The mining [[recession]] in the 1980s helped to evolve Dave Smith Motors into a thriving dealership. As other dealerships were going out of business in the valley Dave Smith bought up nine other new car dealerships and sold all the brands under one roof.<ref name="spokesman">{{cite news|title=Dave Smith leads world in Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep sales|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2007/jan/06/dave-smith-leads-world-in-dodge-chrysler-jeep/|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman Review|date=January 6, 2007}}</ref> He also cut prices in an attempt to make up in volume what was lost in mark-ups. The strategy paid off and became what the dealership now calls '''Hassle Free Buying'''. Smith puts it this way, “A lot of people don't like the hassle of going from dealer to dealer, If they can go to one dealership and get a great price every time, then yes, it is worth it and they do save the money and the frustration."<ref name="spokesman" /> At any given time the dealership has more new vehicles on lots in town than the population of Kellogg.<ref>{{cite news|title=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2007/jan/06/dave-smith-leads-world-in-dodge-chrysler-jeep/|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2007/jan/06/dave-smith-leads-world-in-dodge-chrysler-jeep/|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman Review|date=6 January 2007}}</ref>

===Internet Sales===
Dave Smith Motors was one of the first car dealerships to take advantage of the [[Internet]]. 
In the late 1990s when many dealerships saw the Internet as a threat,<ref name="Bradsher">{{cite news|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|title=A New Era Of Wheeling And Dealing; Rising Competition Squeezes Car Sellers|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/30/business/a-new-era-of-wheeling-and-dealing-rising-competition-squeezes-car-sellers.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 January 1998}}</ref> Dave Smith embraced the Internet and used it as a tool to increase sales. Since the beginning of the list, Dave Smith Motors has ranked high on Ward’s Auto e-Dealer 100 list.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Mac|title=E-Dealer Pros Sharpen Their Game|url=http://wardsauto.com/2012-edealer/e-dealer-pros-sharpen-their-game|publisher=WardsAuto|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> Dave Smith Motors uses the Internet to reach beyond the geographic confines of their remote location in [[Kellogg, Idaho]].

===Boycott===
Selling vehicles over the Internet had its challenges for Dave Smith. The Internet changed the playing field for dealerships because [[Chrysler Corporation]] (now [[DaimlerChrysler]]) allocates more cars to dealerships that sell more, a policy that rewards dealers who are able to boost their sales.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Bob|title=Car dealers yield sales to Internet|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9809/03/cardeal.idg/index.html?iref=allsearch|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=3 September 1998}}</ref> Despite the concerns of competing dealerships Chrysler continued to ship even more vehicles to Dave Smith Motors, and assured other dealers that they could increase sales by improved customer service and referrals.<ref name="Bradsher" /> The other dealerships were not pleased. In 1998 twenty-five Chrysler dealerships in five states threatened to [[boycott]] Chrysler Corporation if they did not reduce the number of cars they allocated to Dave Smith Motors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garner|first=Rochelle|journal=Sales and Marketing Management|date=June 1999|pages=54–61|pages=151}}</ref>  The [[Federal Trade Commission]] considered their boycott illegal<ref>{{cite news|title=Auto Dealers Settle Charges of Boycott|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/06/business/auto-dealers-settle-charges-of-boycott.html|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 August 1998}}</ref>  and the group settled the charges before the boycott began.
