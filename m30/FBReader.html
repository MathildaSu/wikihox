'''FBReader''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open source]] [[e-book reader]] for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and other platforms.

It was originally written for the [[Sharp Zaurus]] and currently runs on many other [[mobile device]]s, like the [[Nokia Internet Tablet]]s, as well as [[desktop computer]]s. A preview of FBReaderJ (the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] port) for Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]] was released on April 13, 2008.

Supported formats include [[EPUB]], [[FictionBook]], [[HTML]], [[plucker]], [[PalmDoc]], [[zTxt]], [[Text Compression for Reader|TCR]], [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|CHM]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[Open eBook|OEB]], [[mobipocket]] (mobi) without [[digital rights management|DRM]], and plain-text.<ref>[http://fbreader.org/about.php FBReader: About FBReader]</ref>
[[File:FBReaderWindow.png|thumb|A desktop version of FBreader]] DAISY 3 format support was added to a fork of FBReaderJ for Android distributed by [[Benetech]] as Go Read for [[Bookshare]] on [[Google Play]].

== History ==
FBReader was originally released for the [[Sharp Zaurus]] in January 2005, a [[Maemo]] port was added in December 2005 for the [[Nokia 770]]. FBReader has since had binary packages released for many mobile device platforms and most major [[personal computer]] (PC) [[operating system]]s.<ref>[http://fbreader.org/obsolete/ FBReader: obsolete versions]</ref>
The FBReader name with the [[FB]] prefix comes from FictionBook, an e-book format which is popular in [[Russia]], the country of FBReader's author.<ref>[http://talk.maemo.org/archive/index.php/t-555.html FBReader and its .fb2 format], maemo.org forum, 2005</ref>

The original FBReader was writting in C++, however in 2007<ref>{{Cite web|title = geometer/FBReaderJ|url = https://github.com/geometer/FBReaderJ/tree/23c429502a1ae00bde925b8fc9e17bde2a3ba5cf|website = GitHub|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}</ref> a fork called FBReaderJ was created, which was written in Java. As the Android platform became available in the following years, this fork became the codebase for the android app, which the C++ codebase remained in use for the other platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|title = geometer/FBReader|url = https://github.com/geometer/FBReader|website = GitHub|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}</ref>
