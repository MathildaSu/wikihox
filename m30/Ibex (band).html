'''Ibex''' was a short-lived [[Liverpool]]-based rock band in 1969. It is primarily known for having [[Freddie Mercury]] (then known as Freddie Bulsara), later of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] fame, as a member. The other members of the band were Mike Bersin on [[guitar]], Mick Smith on [[Drum kit|drums]] and John 'Tupp' Taylor (later [[Jim Capaldi]]'s manager) on [[bass guitar]]. In October 1969, the band changed its name to '''Wreckage''' but broke up in November 1969.

On 9 September 1969, the band performed a concert at The Sink in Liverpool, which included an encore with future Queen members [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]. This was their first ever performance together.

After Ibex, Mercury performed in [[Sour Milk Sea (band)| Sour Milk Sea]], before joining new band (later to become Queen) with Taylor and May after bassist and singer [[Tim Staffell]] broke up Smile. 

A Wreckage demo called "Green" and Ibex's live cover of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]" would later appear on Mercury's posthumous solo box set in 2000. Live recordings exist of "[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]", "[[Communication Breakdown]]", "[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]", and "[[We're Going Wrong]]", but they have never been officially released.

The band reformed in 2005 to play at the Official Queen Fan Club convention with tribute band front man Harry Hamilton of "Flash Harry" taking Freddie's place as singer. They also played support to Flash Harry in their 2004 [[Royal Albert Hall]] show. The only existing records are live and cover versions.
