Amala Rose Kurian, who plays the remorseless Urmila in Padasaram, recalls a recent experience. "I was at a hospital when a three-year-old girl spotted me and started crying out to her mother. She went on to say, 'I hate you Urmila, you are cruel!' In the initial days, such experiences used to affect me badly. But now I have learnt to look at it as an appreciation for portraying my character realistically."
