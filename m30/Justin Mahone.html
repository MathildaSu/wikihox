'''Justin Mahone''' (born 4 April 1999) is a British UK Youth Parliament politician who has been the DMYP in West Cumbria since Early 2016 and the National Executive for North West England since Late 2016. He was previously Chair of Young Labour (2014–16).

==Early life and education==

Mahone was born in [Whitehaven], a small village town in Cumbria at the local West Cumberland Hospital, the only son and only child within that branch of the Mahone family. Mahone's mother worked in the local eatery at that moment, she later decided to move to teaching employment. One of Mahone's aunts, had been campaigning for [The Labour Party], to hopefully be nominated for candidate in her constituency to run as Member of Parliament. 
Mahone is currently being educated in Lakes College - West Cumbria, studying Computer Science. Lakes College is the largest and main college metropolis in the area. Mahone was at one point Student Governor and Student Union Executive within the college, making strategic decisions on behalf of the student body.
Mahone began into party politics from the age of 13, later moving onto youth democracy programs and initiatives at the age of 15. Mahone is still working with both political channels, as he wishes to improve he's experience within the political fields.

==Democracy Channels==

For the past 5 years, Mahone has been involved with various political and democratic channels within his local constituency and region. In the majority of channels, Mahone's work is negotiating with core decision makers in order for action to be made on behalf of his constituents. In Youth Democracy channels, his constituents are from 11–19 years of age inclusive.
As DMYP, and National Representative, Mahone spearheaded the drive for the non closure of NHS Services at West Cumberland Hospital, resulting in endless campaigning. This was an attempt for the National Health Secretary, [[Jeremy Hunt]], to keep the hospital fully funded and established; this was one of the major campaigns that allowed Mahone to win the next election. Mahone was elected to be Deputy Member of the [UK Youth Parliament] on 6 June 2016, succeeding predecessor Glen McAlpine, which resides in Cockermouth, Cumbria.
