'''Paulo Pinheiro''' is a [[Brazilian American]] computer scientist working in the areas of [[provenance]] and [[semantic web]] in support of sciences. Paulo has been a research scientist at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]'s Tetherless World Constellation since 2013.<ref>http://tw.rpi.edu/web/person/PauloPinheiro</ref> Between 2011 and 2013, he was a staff scientist at the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]'s [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]]. Between 2006 and 2012, he was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]]. Paulo is from a long line of scientists and engineers: his father is a retired professor of material sciences at the [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais]]; his paternal grandfather was the founding Mine Superintendent of [[Vale (mining company)|Vale S.A.]], the second largest mining company in the world<ref>http://www.mineweb.com/archive/top-10-miners-a-tough-year-for-ceos-and-for-stock-prices/</ref> and [[Israel Pinheiro da Silva]], a great-grand-uncle, was the chief engineer responsible for the construction of [[Brasilia]], the capital of [[Brazil]].

== Education ==

Paulo received a Licenciatura in Mathematics and a Masters degree in Computer Science from the [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]], and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [[University of Manchester]], [[United Kingdom]] in 2002. Between 2002 and 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [[Knowledge Systems Laboratory]] at [[Stanford University]], [[USA]] and a Sistemas de Informação's faculty member at Faculdades INESC/Unai, Brazil.

== Research ==

Paulo's research focuses on innovative ways of using semantically-enable resources such as ontologies, abstract process specifications, and distributed provenance in support of trust and uncertainty management for sciences. Paulo is the author of the [[Unified Modeling Language for Interactive Systems]] (UMLi) developed as part of his PhD work at the [[School of Computer Science, University of Manchester#Information Management|Information Management Group]] at the University of Manchester. Paulo is a co-author of the [[Provenance Markup Language]] (PML) originally developed at Stanford's [[Knowledge Systems Laboratory]].
