The [[Criminal Lawyers' Association]] (CLA) of Canada questioned section 23 of the [[Ontario]] [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)|Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act]]; they desired access to state records of alleged [[misconduct]] by state officials in a [[murder]] trial because they were concerned about the disparity between the findings at trial and the conclusion of the police investigation. The documents in question were three in number, of which two consisted of privileged legal advice to the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].  The CLA claimed that their right in section 2(b) of the [[Charter]] overrode section 23.  The 76-paragraph judgment by [[McLachlin CJ]] and [[Abella J]], with unanimous concurrence, confirmed the constitutionality of section 23, ie, ruled that [[Legal professional privilege|solicitor-client privilege]] override the [[public interest]].<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=IiMHDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT258 Patrick Keyser: "Public Sentinels: A Comparative Study of Australian Solicitors-General"], Routledge 2016</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=RzerCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT334 Laverne Jacobs, Sasha Baglay: "The Nature of Inquisitorial Processes in Administrative Regimes: Global Perspectives"], Routledge 2016</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LhelDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA103 Richard Devlin, Adam Dodek: "Regulating Judges"], Edward Elgar Publishing 2016.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=-F_gyzny_XgC&pg=PT303 Philip Slayton: "Mighty Judgment: How The Supreme Court Of Canada Runs Your Life"], Penguin Canada, 2011.</ref>

Although the case dealt with civil rights, which lie under provincial jurisdiction, the case was joined by a plethora of [[Attorneys-General]] who acted as [[intervenors]], most of whom had in their own legislation near-verbatim copies of section 23.
