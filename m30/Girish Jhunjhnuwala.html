==Background==

Girish Jhunjhnuwala was born in Hong Kong on September 2, 1963. In 1984, he graduated from the Marshall School of Business at the University of South California and started managing his family’s Hong Kong based OEM watch business, named Hind Corporation. Hind Group was started by Shyam Sundar Jhunjhnuwala (Girish Jhunjhnuwala’s father) in Rangoon (now Yangoon in Myanmar) in 1918. The company manufactured and exported textiles and garments to other countries. Jhunjhnuwala family relocated to Hong Kong in 1960s after the military coup and started the watch manufacturing business. 


Girish Jhunjhnuwala eventually sold this business and started Ovolo Hotels in 2002 by acquiring a single office complex in the heart of Hong Kong’s Central Business District. Jhunjhnuwala developed this complex into the first Ovolo serviced apartment. 


Girish has overseen the growth of Ovolo Group from a one serviced-apartment company to a large portfolio of hotels, cafes and serviced apartments in Hong Kong. The Group recently expanded to Australia and has upcoming projects in Asia.
