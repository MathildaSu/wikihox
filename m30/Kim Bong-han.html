'''Bong-Han Kim''' (born 1916) was a [[North Korea]]n medical surgeon at [[Pyongyang Medical University]] and Kyung-Rak institute. He is recognized to have discovered the so called [[primo-vascular system]] in five research reports that were published during the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Soh|first=Kwang-Sup|author2=Kang, Kyung A. |author3=Ryu, Yeon Hee |title=50 Years of Bong-Han Theory and 10 Years of Primo Vascular System|journal=''[[Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]''|date=1 January 2013|volume=2013|pages=1–12|doi=10.1155/2013/587827|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/587827/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jun-Ling|author2=Jing, Xiang-Hong |author3=Shi, Hong |author4=Chen, Shu-Ping |author5=He, Wei |author6=Bai, Wan-Zhu |author7= Zhu, Bing |title=Historical Review about Research on "Bonghan System" in China|journal=''[[Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]''|date=1 January 2013|volume=2013|pages=1–7|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/636081/|doi=10.1155/2013/636081}}</ref>

Prior to his arrival in North Korea, B.H. Kim was affiliated with the [[Korea Democratic Party]].<ref name="nk1"/>

== Primo-vascular system ==
While working as Director of [[North Korea]]'s Kyung-Rak institute (KRI) from 1962 to 1965, B.H. Kim published five articles in the ''Journal of Jo Sun Medicine'' about [[acupuncture]], the Kyungrak system, and the "Sanal" theory. These articles form the basis of the proposed [[primo-vascular system]], which attracted some interest in the early 2010s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kwang-Sup Soh, Kyung A. Kang, David K. Harrison,|title=The primo vascular system : its role in cancer and regeneration|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-0600-6|pages=7–17|url=http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-0601-3_2.pdf|edition=1.}}</ref>

The [[North Korean government]] supported Kim's research by supplying his team with various analytical instruments such as [[microscope]]s and [[radioactive tracer]]s, most of which were imported from [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name="nk1"/>

== Disappearance ==

In 1966, the Kyung-Rak research institute was shut down. As of today, no traces of Dr. Kim and his research institute have been found.<ref name="kim"/>

{{quote|Dr. Kim claimed that microcells inside the primo vascular system conducted [[cell therapy]], although the term as he used it had no equal in the scientific discourse of the time.

Unfortunately he did not reveal the dyes or methods he used to get his results, so the research lay dormant for quite some time. Dr. Kim claimed that microcells inside the primo vascular system conducted cell therapy, although the term as he used it had no equal in the scientific discourse of the time. However, since then the idea of stem cells and tissue regeneration has been scientifically detailed, and matches up remarkably well with Dr. Kim's claims. If he had not been working in isolation in a regime hostile to international cooperation this system might have been thoroughly explored by now.}}</ref> }}
