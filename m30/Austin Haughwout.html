'''Austin Haughwout''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|ə|t}}, born November 13, 1996<ref>{{cite news|url=http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2015/07/23/drone-teen-arrested-in-clinton/|title=Drone Teen Arrested In Clinton|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=23 Jul 2015}}</ref>) is an American [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] hobbyist and former engineering student from [[Clinton, Connecticut]], known for [[YouTube]] videos relating to his use of drones. He is most recently known for his expulsion from Central Connecticut State University on the grounds of threatening a mass shooting in campus.

==Assault victim==
Haughwout first received media attention over an earlier incident in May 2014, when at the age of 17 he was assaulted by a 23-year-old woman who objected to his use of a drone for photography at a public beach. Haughwout recorded a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elnENHrliKc video] of the assault on his cellphone and posted it to YouTube. The woman was sentenced to two years' probation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wptv.com/news/national/andrea-mears-austin-haughwout-woman-charged-with-assault-over-drone-with-camera-filming-at-beach |title=Andrea Mears, Austin Haughwout: Woman charged with assault over drone with camera filming at beach |publisher=[[WPTV-TV]] |last=Detelj |first=Tina |date=11 Jun 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312021040/http://www.wptv.com/news/national/andrea-mears-austin-haughwout-woman-charged-with-assault-over-drone-with-camera-filming-at-beach |archivedate=2016-03-12 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nypost.com/2014/07/10/woman-gets-probation-after-assaulting-pervy-teen-drone-pilot/|title=Woman gets probation after assaulting ‘pervy’ teen drone pilot|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=10 Jul 2015|authors=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox61.com/2014/06/19/woman-from-viral-drone-video-appears-in-court/|title=Woman From Viral Drone Video Appears In Court|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]|date=19 Jul 2014|last=Charlton|first=John}}</ref>

==Drone video controversies==

===Drone with gun===
In July 2015, Haughwout, then an engineering student at [[Central Connecticut State University]] (CCSU), posted a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHrTtvFFIs video] on YouTube showing a drone carrying a [[semi-automatic handgun]], which he had assembled, and which was seen to fire the gun several times. The drone was flying in woodland behind his home. The video, posted on July 10, had received almost 2 million views by July 21, and led to an [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] investigation as to whether Haughwout had violated aviation law, although local police said that they did not believe that he had violated state law.<ref name=guardian-gun-drone>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/21/drone-handgun-video-teen-connecticut|title=Teen's video of handgun-toting drone prompts federal investigation|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 Jul 2015|authors=Associated Press}}</ref><ref name=cnsnews-gun-drone>{{cite news|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/teenagers-video-gun-firing-drone-spurs-investigation|title=Teenager's video of gun-firing drone spurs investigation|authors=Associated Press|date=21 Jul 2015|publisher=[[Cybercast News Service]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/21/flying-gun-drone-investigated-faa-after-engineerin/|title=‘Flying Gun’ drone investigated by FAA after student’s YouTube video goes viral|last=Ernst|first=Douglas|date=21 Jul 2015|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]}}</ref>

===Drone with flamethrower===
In December 2015, Haughwout uploaded a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmD3rXUR1Tw video] of a drone carrying a [[flame thrower]], which he had also created, and which was being used to roast a turkey. Again, the local police stated that no laws were broken.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/watch-teen-tests-fire-breathing-turkey-roasting-drone-article-1.2460793|title=WATCH: Connecticut teen tests fire-breathing, turkey-roasting drone|last=Alba|first=Alejandro|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=9 Dec 2015}}</ref>

==Legislation==
The video with the drone-mounted handgun had been posted weeks after a proposal in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]] to restrict armed drones had lapsed because of inaction. In early 2016, state legislators tabled [https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&bill_num=SB00148&which_year=2016 two new bills] that would impose restrictions on drone weaponization. The police seargeant who had investigated the gun video stated that, although a [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] supporter, she supported regulation "because I don't see any, any civilian purpose for a flying gun".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3468200/Drone-mounted-handgun-flamethrower-reignite-lawmaker-debate.html|title=Connecticut lawmakers fight to ban ARMED drones after teenager built terrifying flying flamethrower and pistol|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|date=28 Feb 2016|last=Wilkinson|first=James}}</ref>

Austin Haughwout testified against legislation to ban adding weapons to UAVs.<ref name=hartford-courant-teen-who-built-gun-firing-drone>{{cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-austin-haughwout-drone-testimony-0301-20160229-story.html|title=Teen Who Built Gun-Firing Drone Testifies Against Drone Legislation|publisher=[[Hartford Courant]]|first=Russell|last=Blair|date=29 Feb 2016|accessdate=29 Mar 2016}}</ref> He argued that the problem wasn't the weaponisation of UAVs but the use, pointing out that assault, murder and recklessly endangering the public were already illegal.<ref name=hartford-courant-teen-who-built-gun-firing-drone/>

==Expulsion==
In October 2015, Haughwout was expelled from CCSU for talking about "attacks on the university".<ref>http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-austin-haughwout-ccsu-lawsuit-0308-20160307-story.html</ref> He says that this is over the drone controversy, and is taking legal action to compel the university to reinstate him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/science-technology/article64975192.html |title=Ex-student expelled over weaponized drone sues school |publisher=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |date=9 Mar 2016 |authors=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312005522/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/science-technology/article64975192.html |archivedate=2016-03-12 |df= }}</ref>
