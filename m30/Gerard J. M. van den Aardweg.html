'''Gerard J. M. van den Aardweg''' (born 1936) is a Dutch [[conservative]] campaigner against homosexuality. Van den Aardweg has published several books on what he sees as the evils of homosexuality and until 2012 sat on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the conservative [[NARTH]], which promotes [[conversion therapy]] for homosexuals.  The group lost [[charitable status]] that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truthwinsout.org/news/2013/02/33102|title=TWO Report: Gerard van den Aardweg, NARTH’s Nastiest Reparative Therapist|work=truthwinsout.org}}</ref>

Aardweg promotes opinion that the ''[[Irish Times]]'' describes as [[conspiracy theories]], including that the [[Nazi party]] was "rooted" in homosexuals, and that homosexuality is being imposed on the world by "freemasonry international."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/dutch-psychologist-links-homosexuality-to-conspiracy-theories-1.2213033|title=Dutch psychologist links homosexuality to conspiracy theories|date=14 May 2015|work=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref>http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2015/05/18/narth-institute-affiliate-addresses-anti-lgbt-audience-in-dublin/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/no-campaigners-criticise-nazi-germany-comparison-1.2213931|title=No campaigners criticise Nazi Germany ‘comparison’|date=15 May 2015|work=The Irish Times}}</ref>
