This article lists goals which have been considered among the fastest ever scored in an [[association football]] matches. The records concerning the fastest goals are disputed for a number of reasons. Ray Spiller of the [[Association of Football Statisticians]] has argued that as there is no official system for recognising the timing of goals there are always going to be disputes concerning these records.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/footballs-fastest-goal-claimed-1524713.html|title=Football's fastest goal claimed|author=GUY HODGSON AND LIZ SEARL|date=23 October 2011|work=The Independent}}</ref>

In addition, many of the goals listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as being among the fasted were not filmed preventing the precise timing of goals from being assessed.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The status of [[Nawaf Al Abed]]'s goal which is  credited as being scored after two seconds is also disputed given that the match was later declared void due ineligible players when several players over the age of 23 were found to have played in the age restricted game.

[[Marc Burrows]] goal has also been considered the fastest ever but it was scored in an amateur reserve game. As there is no standard size for a football pitch some of the goals listed benefit from being played on smaller pitches that require the ball to travel a shorter distance before reaching the goal. Furthermore, many of the records listed come from English language publications and reflect a bias towards English football within the sources.

Under [[Laws of the Game (association football)|The Laws of the Game]], specifically [[The Start and Restart of Play (association football)|Law 8]], goals may be scored directly from the [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-off]]. Some of the fastest goals on the list below are shots taken directly from the kick-off.

Some sources consider [[Nawaf Al Abed]] to have scored the fastest ever goal in a football match although the status of this record is disputed.
