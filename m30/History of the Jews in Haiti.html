The '''history of the Jews in Haiti''' is a rather long and complex one, as it stretches from the very beginning of the European settlement on the new island, to the beginning of the [[Haitian Revolution]] when the [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legions]] ''(some of whom were Jews)'' were sent to [[Saint-Domingue]] by Napoleon to vanquish the slave rebellion, to the time of the [[Holocaust]].

As of 2013, the Jewish population is around 25. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/haiti.html |title=Haiti |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref>
