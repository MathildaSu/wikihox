'''CubicWeb''' is an [[open source]] semantic [[web application framework]], licensed under the LGPL.<ref>http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/CubicWeb</ref> It is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

It has been an open free software project since October 2008, but the project began in 2000 and was initially developed by [http://www.logilab.fr/ Logilab] for internal uses such as intranet, bug tracker and forge applications.

As of 2012, CubicWeb is being used in large-scale semantic web and linked open data applications<ref>http://data.bnf.fr/semanticweb</ref><ref>Simon, A., Wenz, R., Michel, V., & Di Mascio, A. (2013). Publishing Bibliographic Records on the Web of Data: Opportunities for the BnF (French National Library). In The Semantic Web: Semantics and Big Data (pp. 563-577). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</ref> and international corporations.<ref>http://lists.cubicweb.org/pipermail/cubicweb/2012-October/001262.html</ref>

== Concepts ==

The framework is entirely driven by a data model. Once the data model is defined, one gets a functional web application and can further customize the views (by default it provides a set of default views for each type of data).

A cube is a reusable component defining specific features. For example a cube [http://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-forge forge] allows one to create one's own forge and the forge cube reuses the cubes comment, file, email, etc. Interesting general purpose cubes include dbpedia and openlibrary.

The framework has been translated to English, French, Spanish and German (April 2011).

== Features ==

* Semantic web: supports [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]/[[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]
* Multi-source: supports RQL, [[SQL]], [[LDAP]], [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] and [[Mercurial]]
* [http://www.logilab.org/project/rql RQL]: Relationship query language to ease data query
* Migration tool: fits into agile development
* View selection principle: the engine selects the best view to fit the content to display according to the context
* Cubes library: a wide range of cubes are available on the forge
