'''Anthropoclouds''' are those [[clouds]] originated by human activities. Although generally clouds covering the sky have only a natural origin, from the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the use [[fossil fuels]] and [[water vapor]] and other gases emitted by nuclear, thermal and geothermal [[power plants]] yield significant alterations of the local [[weather]] conditions. On certain occasions, the new atmospheric conditions can enhance [[cloud formation]]. It is precisely these clouds generated due to human activities, which are called '''anthropoclouds'''.

==Anthropocloud formation==
Three conditions are needed to form a cloud: (i) the air must contain a certain amount of water vapor, (ii) the air must be cooled to the dew point [[temperature]] with respect water (or [[ice]]) to [[condensate]] (or [[sublimate]]) part of the water vapor, (iii) the air must contain [[condensation nuclei]], small solid particles, where condensation/sublimation starts.
The current use of fossil fuels enhances any of these three conditions. First, fossil fuel combustion generates water vapor. Additionally, this combustion also generates the formation of small solid particles that can act as condensation nuclei. Finally, all the combustion processes emit energy that enhance vertical upward movements. 
Despite all the processes involving the combustion of fossil fuels help the three conditions mentioned above, only some human activities, such as, thermal power plants, commercial aircrafts or chemical industries modify enough the atmospheric conditions to produce clouds that we will call '''anthropoclouds''' due to its anthropic origin.

==How to name them?==
The ''[[International Cloud Atlas]]'' published by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] compiles the proposal made by [[Luke Howard]] at the beginning of the XIX century, and all the subsequent modifications. Each natural cloud has a name in Latin and clouds are classified attending their shape, color and height in ten different basic genera.
Anthropoclouds are classified following the same criterion but putting the prefix ''anthropo'' – before the name of the corresponding cloud (Mazon et al., 2012). For instance, a ''[[Cumulus]]'' originated by human activity has to be named as an ''anthropocumulus''.
Additionally, when annotating meteorological observations the letter ''a''- has to be placed before each cloud abbreviation to differentiate anthropoclouds from the clouds having a natural origin. Again, a ''cumulus'' usually indicated by ''Cu'', has to be noted as ''aCu'' when it is originated due to human activity.

==Types and classification==
The international cloud classification considers three main groups of clouds:
• High clouds 
• Middle clouds
• Low clouds
We analyze below which genera within these groups can have an anthropic origin and what it is its formation process.

===High anthropoclouds=== 
Despite the three genera of high clouds, ''[[Cirrus]]'', ''[[Cirrocumulus]]'' and ''[[Cirrostratus]]'', form at the top of the [[troposphere]], far from the earth surface, they may have an anthropogenic origin. In this case, the process that causes their formation is almost always the same: commercial and military aircraft flight. Exhaust products from the combustion of the [[kerosene]] expelled by engines provide water vapor to this region of the troposphere. In addition, the strong contrast between the cold air of the high troposphere layers and the warm and moist air ejected by aircraft engines causes rapid sublimation of water vapor forming small [[ice crystals]]. This process is also enhanced by the presence of abundant nuclei of condensation produced as a result of combustion.
[[File:High anthropoclouds in the sky of Barcelona (November, 2010)..JPG|thumbnail|''Anthropocirrocúmulus'' (''aCc'') i ''Anthropocirroestratus'' (''aCs'') observed over Barcelona (Spain, November 2010).]]
The condensation trails ([[contrails]]) initially produce a lineal cloud of ''cirrus'' shape Anthropocirrus (aCi). Due to the large temperature difference between the air exhausted and the ambiance air generates small-scale [[convection]] processes. These processes favor the evolution of the condensation trails to ''Anthropocirrocumulus'' (''aCc''). Depending on the atmospheric conditions at the upper part of the troposphere, where the plane is flying, these high anthropoclouds rapidly disappear or persist. When the air is dry and stable, the water rapidly evaporates inside the anthropoclouds, and contrails can only observed up to several hundreds of meters from the plane. On the other hand, if [[humidity]] is enough high it exists an ice [[oversaturation]] and the anthropoclouds get wide and it can exist for hours.
In this last case, depending on the wind conditions ''aCc'' may evolve to  ''Anthropocirrus''(''aCi''), or ''Anthropocirrostratus'' (''aCs''). The existence and persistence of these three types of high anthropoclouds may indicate the approximation of a perturbation. In some cases, when there is a large density of air traffic, these high anthropoclouds may inhibit the formation of natural high clouds, because the contrails capture most of the water vapor.
 
===Middle anthropoclouds=== 
The intermediate layers of the troposphere are the regions with less influence of human activity. This region is enough far from the surface for not being affected by the surface emissions. Additionally, commercial and military flights only cross this region during ascending or descending maneuvers. 
Moreover, in this region there exist two types of clouds with a large horizontal extension: ''[[Nimbostratus]]'' and ''[[Altostratus]]'', which can be hardly originated due to human activity. Consequently, it is assumed that there are not anthropic clouds of these two genera. However, what can occur is that a natural preexistence ''Nimbostratus'' or ''Altostratus'' may grow due to the additional water vapor or condensation nuclei emitted by a thermal power plant, for instance. 

The only anthropic clouds existing in the middle region of the troposphere are ''Anthropoaltocumulus'' (''aAc''). These clouds may be originated similarly to ''aCc'', but concerning the contrails at this region.

===Low anthropoclouds===
The lowest part of the atmosphere is the region with the largest influence of human activity that emits water vapor, warm air, and condensation nuclei.

When the atmosphere is stable, the additional contribution of warm and moist air from emissions enhances [[fog]] formation, i. e. layers of ''Anthropostratus'' (''aSt'').
[[File:Anthropostratus near Vic (February, 2011)..JPG|thumbnail|Anthropostratus (aSt) formed due to the emissions of a dairy factory near Gurb (Spain, February 2011).]]
If the air is not stable, this warm and moist air emitted by human activities creates a convective movement that can reach the lifted condensation level producing an anthropic cumulus cloud, an ''Anthropocumulus'' (''aCu''). This type of clouds may be also observed over the polluted air covering some cities or industrial areas in high-pressure conditions.

''Anthropostratocumulus'' (''aSc'') are anthropic clouds that may be formed due to the evolution of ''aSt'' if the atmosphere is slightly unstable or from ''aCu'' if the atmosphere is stable.
[[File:Anthropocumulus above a power station at Barcelona (Desember, 2008)..JPG|thumbnail|''Anthropocúmulus'' (''aCu'') formed due to the emissions of the thermal power plant in Sant Adrià del Besós (Spain, December 2008).]]
Finally, ''Cumulonimbus'' (''Cb'') presents such a great vertical development that only in some particular cases they can be created by anthropic causes. For instance, large wild fires may yield to the formation of pyrocumulus that have evolve the ''Anthropocumulonimbus'' (''aCb''). 
 
==Influence on climate==
There are many studies dealing with the importance and effects of high anthropic clouds (Penner, 1999; Minna et al., 1999, 2003 y 2004; Marquart et al., 2002 y 2003; Stuber and Foster, 2006, 2007), but not about anthropic clouds in general. For the particular case of ''aCi'' due to contrails, [[IPCC]] estimates positive radiative forcing around 0.01 Wm<sup>-2</sup>.

When annotating the weather data, using the prefix that indicates the cloud origin allows differentiating these clouds form the ones with natural origin. Once this notation is established, after several years of observations, the influence of anthropoclouds on earth [[climate]] will be clearly analyzed.
