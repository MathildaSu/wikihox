==Early life and education==
Dexter Gore, Jr. was born on September 6, 1993 in [[Manhattan]], a borough of [[New York City]], [[New York]], to deceased parents Dexter Gore, Sr. (father) and Pamela Winters (mother).<ref name="Discogs"/> He lived in [[Harlem]], one of Manhattan's historical neighborhoods. Dex was also the fourth youngest of twelve children, the fourth of five half-siblings, as well as the youngest of 3½ step-siblings.<ref name="Discogs"/> Seven days before his first birthday in late 1994, Dex's elder sister was gunned down in a [[drive-by shooting]] while exiting a local [[McDonald's]].<ref name="Discogs"/>

After his sister's death, Dex's mother relocated the family to 145th Street & Lenox Ave., Harlem's dangerous, crime-riddled street address. While living inside an apartment, Dex attended Harlem Prep Elementary School. There, he met and befriended classmate and rapper [[Azealia Banks]].<ref name="Discogs"/> By the end of 1994, his family's apartment complex was foreclosed on a government loan. Also, the building was severely used as a setting on part of the 1995 [[crime drama]], ''[[New Jersey Drive]]'', which details the growing automotive theft rate in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. Enraged, Dex's father left the family to attend the military while the rest flew to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name="Discogs"/> While ''New Jersey Drive'', directed by [[Nick Gomez]] and produced by [[Spike Lee]], premiered in April, Dex began listening to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], but dangerously, his family lived on a top floor of the [[Robert Taylor Homes]] on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] section of Chicago. Unfortunately, Dex's mother financial condition turned out poor; At seven years of age, he was sent out to a Catholic school located in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]].<ref name="Discogs"/>

In January 1997, Dex's father got fired from his job as a lieutenant of the military. Later, his father was charged with conspiracy, drug and weapon possession and assault; he was sentenced to death and was publicly executed that September.<ref name="Discogs"/> Dex was released from a Catholic school and sent back to the Robert Taylor Homes, but his return was short-lived when the building of the complex was demolished in 1998. After seeing this, he left his family alone and used his mother's lost jewelry to buy himself a house. However, with a population of fostered children on the rise in mid-2000, he reunited with his mother and the two settled down.<ref name="Discogs"/> A year later, his grandmother spent annual time in New York City (Dex's birthplace). Tragically, in 2001, while his grandmother was inside the [[7 World Trade Center]] on the eighteenth row, several jets crashed onto the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], amid the [[September 11 attacks]]. Dex's grandmother died eight days later after suffering from an "after-burn".<ref name="Discogs"/> In 2004, Dex had a disagreement with his mother over his grandmother's tragic death. At this point, he was kicked out of his mother's house and was never heard from again. That same year, he attended [Irene C.] Hernández Middle School in Chicago, where he befriended female rap artist Kay-Mice, the surrogate sister of [[Da Brat]].<ref name="Discogs"/> Gore also attended [[Paul Robeson High School (Chicago)|Paul Robeson High School]] in [[Englewood, Chicago]], where he also met fellow hometown rappers [[Lil Durk]] and [[Chief Keef]]. However, with poor grades, he was kicked out and sent back to Catholic school.<ref name="Discogs"/>

==Career==
In [[Autumn]] 2011, after spending eight months in a hospital, Dex later [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitated]] and decided to become a [[rapper]]. He later developed the alias '''Black Migo Dex''', because of his [[African-American]] and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] cultures as well as his religion to being a [[Muslim]].<ref name="Discogs"/> In 2013, he received the advanced attention with the respective remixes of Chief Keef's "Kobe" and in 2014, with [[Dej Loaf]]'s "[[Try Me (Dej Loaf song)|Try Me]]". Later on, he released his first single, "Bottle After Bottle".<ref name="Discogs"/> However, after a short period of using his stage name, he decided to rename himself '''Famous Dex'''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Controversy around him aroused in October 2014 when fellow Chicago-bred rapper Young Pappy dissed Dex and Lil Mouse via his viral single, "Killa".<ref name=Discogs1>{{cite web|title=Young Pappy discography at Discogs|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4489969-Young-Pappy|publisher=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=2016-08-07}}</ref> May 29, 2015, Pappy was murdered in his hometown during a video shoot.<ref name=Discogs1/> A week after Young Pappy's murder, Dex and a companion released a tribute track in honor of his memory.<ref name="Discogs"/>

Then, in 2015, he [[self-released]] his first mixtape, ''Never Seen It Coming''. The mixtape was downloaded below 100,000 times, but its track, "Duh Dummy!", gained popularity.<ref>http://indy.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/34702/famous-dex-never-seen-it-coming.html</ref> Later that year, he released his second mixtape, ''Dexter's Laboratory''; the title of this mixtape is the same as the critically praised [[Dexter's Laboratory|Cartoon Network original animated television series]]. [[Cartoon Network]] and its parent owner [[Time Warner]] threatened a lawsuit against Dex for infringing their trademarks.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In early 2016, Famous Dex released his third and fourth mixtapes, ''Drippy'' and ''#OhhMannGoddDamn'', respectively.<ref>https://www.inverse.com/article/15815-who-is-the-hell-is-famous-dex-and-should-you-care</ref> Dex grew to population again with the respective singles, "Drip from My Walk" and "2 Times".<ref name="MTV1"/> He later recruited [[Rich the Kid]] and [[Wiz Khalifa]] for the latter's remix.<ref>http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/famous-dex-2-times-remix-feat-wiz-khalifa-and-rich-the-kid-new-song.1970291.html</ref>

In the summer of 2016, Dex announced that he was officially signed to Rich the Kid's label, Rich Forever Music, through a distribution deal with [[300 Entertainment]], under the aegis of [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sxHZ8K33yQ</ref><ref>http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.38986/title.famous-dex-reportedly-signs-to-300-entertainment-joining-fetty-wap-young-thug-migos</ref><ref>http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/03/rich-the-kid-signs-famous-dex/</ref> Shortly thereafter, Dex and Rich released their collaborative effort, "Rich Forever", a song with the same name as the latter artist's label,<ref>http://www.fakeshoredrive.com/2016/06/famous-dex-f-rich-kid-rich-forever.html/</ref> and also announced a co-headlining tour to start in mid-2016.<ref>http://www.ticketalternative.com/event/rich-the-kid-w-famous-dex-rich-forever-tour</ref>
