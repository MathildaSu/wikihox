* † {{flagicon|US}} '''Lieutenant General "Gold Eagle" Shepherd''' - The main antagonist in ''Modern Warfare 2''. He is the commander of Task Force 141 and also the [[U.S. Army Rangers]]. In ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', he lost 30,000 men when Vladimir Makarov (proved in Yuri's flashback from MW3) set off a nuclear bomb. Angry and disillusioned by this and the world's refusal to listen to his warnings that Russia is becoming an ultra-nationalist state, Shepherd begins to operate on his own. He heads Task Force 141 and hunts Russian terrorist Vladimir Makarov, eventually ordering his elite soldiers, Shadow Company, to eliminate them both. He is revealed to be responsible for the Russian-American war, his goal being to make America once again undisputed as the sole world superpower- and himself as the hero who made it so.

In the end of the mission, Makarov, aware of Allen's true identity, kills the agent and leaves him behind to be discovered by Russian police, leading the Russians to believe that it was a U.S. led attack. This in turn causes a war between Russia and the United States. At the end of the game, he supplies Price and MacTavish with intel leading them to Shepherd's location, and goes into hiding. Makarov would become the primary antagonist of ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. He is voiced by the voice actor Roman Varshavsky.

He is voiced by [[Troy Baker]].
*{{flagdeco|US}} '''Sergeant Foley''' - Sgt. Foley is a [[U.S. Army Rangers|Ranger]] member. He is also the acting leader of Hunter Two-One. He is seen in "''S.S.D.D.''" training Allen.

==''Call of Duty: Black Ops''==

===Protagonists===
*{{flagicon|US}} '''Agent Alex Mason''' is the first and primary playable character. He first appears at the very beginning of the game, being interrogated by members of an unknown organization who are trying to get information out of him. In the first level of the game, Mason and his teammates Joseph Bowman and Frank Woods infiltrated [[Cuba]] in order to assassinate [[Fidel Castro]] during the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. Though Mason appears to succeed in killing Castro, he strands himself on Cuba while ensuring that Woods and Bowman escaped by plane; it was revealed shortly thereafter that he had actually killed Castro's body double, and the real one was still alive. Castro then gave Mason to the Soviet General Nikita Dragovich, who imprisoned him at the [[Vorkuta Gulag]]. During his two-year imprisonment, he befriended Viktor Reznov, a former Russian soldier. He and Reznov sparked a major prison uprising to escape from Vorkuta, but only Mason managed to escape. Afterwards, Mason was brought to [[The Pentagon]] with Jason Hudson and [[Robert McNamara]], where he meets President [[John F. Kennedy]], who authorizes the assassination of Dragovich. Mason and his team were dispatched to the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in order to disrupt the Soviet space program and kill Dragovich, though the mission went wrong when one of their teammates, Weaver, was captured. Though they managed to save him and destroyed a Russian rocket as it tried to take off, Dragovich escaped. Five years later, Mason was dispatched to [[Vietnam]], where he was reunited with his old teammates and repelled an attack by the [[North Vietnamese Army]] at the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]]. In [[Hue City]], they were sent to look for a man who was trying to defect to the West; the defector appears to be Viktor Reznov, who has since escaped from Vorkuta. They are, however, captured once again, and, after the presumed death of Frank Woods and murder of Bowman, only Mason is left. He and Reznov then infiltrated Rebirth Island, a Soviet research station where the deadly chemical Nova 6 was manufactured and weaponized, in order to kill Friedrich Steiner, a German scientist who defected to the Soviet Union near the end of [[World War II]]. During the interrogation, Mason recalls that Reznov was the one who killed Steiner, but it was actually Mason himself who did so; it is revealed that Mason was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] at Vorkuta to eventually assassinate President Kennedy, though it is unclear what his actual involvement in the assassination is. Viktor Reznov managed to tamper with the brainwashing process and turned Mason against his former brainwashers, Mason suffered from a personality disorder as a result, and he thought that Reznov was real but he himself was Viktor Reznov, thus altering his memory of past events where he thought Reznov was involved. Mason is voiced by [[Sam Worthington]].

*{{flagicon|US}} '''Special Agent Jason Hudson''' is a secondary player character, who was Mason's handler and turns out to be the man interrogating him throughout the game. His first formal appearance is when he is escorting Mason into The Pentagon. He worked together with Mason and Woods in Vietnam. Hudson becomes playable for the first time in the fourth level of the game, set in [[Hong Kong]] as he is interrogating Daniel Clarke, a British defector who weaponized Nova 6. Later in the game, Hudson and a team of other agents were sent to apprehend Steiner on Rebirth Island, at the same time that Mason and Reznov were there to kill him, acting against orders. In order to stop Nova 6 from being used on civilians, Hudson interrogates Mason to try to find out what the numbers that Clarke had mentioned meant. Hudson is voiced by [[Ed Harris]].<ref name="Gary Oldman And Ed Harris In Call Of Duty: Black Ops">{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5631536/gary-oldman-and-ed-harris-in-call-of-duty-black-ops | title=Gary Oldman And Ed Harris In Call Of Duty: Black Ops | publisher=kotaku | date=Sep 7, 2010 | accessdate=Sep 7, 2010}}</ref>

* † {{flagicon|USSR}} '''{{Visible anchor|Captain Viktor Reznov}}''' ({{lang-ru|'''Виктор Резнов'''}}) is another playable character, returning from ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'', though is only playable in one level. He first appeared in the second level as a prisoner in Vorkuta, where he and Mason became friends. Reznov instigated a large-scale uprising by the prisoners, but was recaptured while Mason escaped. He and Mason appeared to reunite in Vietnam, where he claimed to be defecting to the West, and saved Mason after the helicopter he was on crashed. Following Kravchenko's death, he and Mason tracked down Steiner on Rebirth Island. Mason actually suffers from [[dissociative identity disorder]]; he himself became Viktor Reznov. At the end of the game, it is revealed that after Mason escaped from Vorkuta, Reznov was actually an illusion in Mason's mind, and Jason Hudson tells Mason that Reznov reversed his brain-washing so that Mason could kill Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner out of revenge for Reznov's comrades (who were killed in 1945 by Dragovich and Kravchenko by exposure to Nova 6) and that the real Reznov was killed after the prison break by Russian soldiers. Reznov is voiced by [[Gary Oldman]].

*{{flagicon|USSR}} '''Special Agent Grigori Weaver''' (Russian: '''Спецагент Григорий Уивер''') is a soldier who defected to the United States after the government-sponsored murder of his father. He is also an engineer who was sent to sabotage a rocket, but was captured and has his left eye cut out by Kravchenko. He also assists Jason Hudson during the interrogation of Daniel Clarke and during the missions on Mt. Yamantau and Rebirth. Towards the end of the game, Weaver becomes more and more distrustful of Mason because of his erratic behavior. It is revealed that he along with Hudson has been interrogating Mason throughout the game. Weaver learns from an anonymous note that his niece is alive in Russia. However, he is never informed that she is a high-ranking government agent. Weaver is voiced by [[Gene Farber]].

*{{flagicon|US}} ''' Master Sergeant Frank Woods''' is a non-playable character, but is an ally of Mason in most of the game's levels. He first appeared in the first level, along with Mason and Bowman, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Woods and Mason are captured by the Vietcong and almost killed during a forced game of [[Russian roulette]]. After escaping the rat tunnels, Woods and Mason eventually commandeered a helicopter and fought their way to where Kravchenko was hiding. Woods sacrificed his own life by tackling Kravchenko and knocking both of them out a window as the latter pulled a grenade. He later appeared alive seconds later, only to be revealed an illusion in the eyes of Mason. He is presumed dead, but an anonymous note sent to Mason (viewable in the interrogation room computer) states that Woods is still alive and imprisoned in Hanoi; the Reveal Trailer for [[Call of Duty: Black Ops II|Black Ops II]] shows he survived until at least he was 95 years old. He is voiced and [[motion-captured]] by James C. Burns.<ref name="http://www.jamescburns.com/Jamescburns/Call_Of_Duty__Black_Ops.html">{{cite web | url=http://www.jamescburns.com/Jamescburns/Call_Of_Duty__Black_Ops.html | title=http://www.jamescburns.com/Jamescburns/Call_Of_Duty__Black_Ops.html | date=December 3, 2010 | accessdate=December 3, 2010}}</ref>

* † {{flagicon|US}} '''Chief Petty Officer Joseph Bowman''' is a non-playable character who appears in several missions as an ally of Mason. He first appeared in the first level, along with Mason and Woods, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Bowman was brutally killed by a [[Spetsnaz]] operative when he insulted him, and refused to play a game of Russian roulette. He is voiced by [[Ice Cube]].

* † {{flagicon|US}} '''[[President of the United States]] [[John F. Kennedy]]''' is the first player character in one version of the Zombie mode. He made only one formal appearance in the campaign, during his meeting with Alex Mason to authorize Nikita Dragovich's assassination, though his voice plays over some parts of the game. He was assassinated in 1963 by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], though Mason appears to have had some form of involvement in the assassination. Kennedy is voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]] and Chriss Anglin.

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]]''' is the second player character in one version of the Zombie mode. Like Kennedy, he only formally appears once in the campaign with his voice dubbed in other sections as well. He brings Alex Mason to Kennedy and helps to conspire to assassinate Nikita Dragovich. He is voiced by [[Robert Picardo]].

* † {{flagicon|USSR}} '''Private Dimitri Petrenko''' (Russian: '''Дмитрий Петренко''') is a returning character from [[Call of Duty: World at War]] and is now an NPC in this game. He is only seen in one mission when the player plays as Reznov and is killed later in the level by exposure to Nova 6. He is voiced by [[Boris Kievsky]].

===Antagonists===
* † {{flagicon|USSR}} '''Major General Nikita Dragovich''' ({{lang-ru|'''Никита Драгович'''}}) is the main antagonist of the story, the instigator of the Nova 6 plot and the attempted invasion of the United States. He first appears at the end of the first level, receiving Mason as a prisoner from Fidel Castro. Dragovich was largely responsible for Mason's brainwashing. His earlier involvement in the Nova 6 plot was in 1945 in the Arctic Circle, when he helped Friedrich Steiner move his chemical weapons out of a ship which had been frozen in place by the weather. Dragovich was killed by Mason at the end of the game by simultaneous choking and drowning. His final words suggest that Mason followed his original programming to assassinate President Kennedy despite Reznov's interference, but even this remains unclear. Dragovich was voiced by Eamon Hunt.

* {{flagicon|USSR}} '''Colonel Lev Kravchenko''' ({{lang-uk|'''Лев Кравченко'''}}) is a secondary antagonist, first appearing when Mason was captured in Cuba. He was also personally responsible for the loss of Weaver's left eye, and though Mason and his team searched feverishly for him, he managed  to escape. He was apparently killed by Woods, who knocked them both through a window and simultaneously pulled the pins from the grenades that Kravchenko had strapped to himself. However, Black Ops II reveals that both men survived and he returns as a minor antagonist. As evidenced by intel found in-game, he was quite sadistic, going so far as to torture his own sister to death to prove his loyalty to Dragovich. He was voiced by [[Andrew Divoff]].

* † {{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} '''Doctor Friedrich Steiner''' is a German scientist responsible for the creation of Nova 6, a nerve toxin which can kill a human being in a matter of seconds. He formally worked for the [[Third Reich]] designing other chemical weapons, but withheld the use of Nova 6 by the Germans and instead handed it over to Dragovich in 1945. He defected to the Soviet Union and continued to develop the toxin. Near the end of the game, Steiner began to have second thoughts and begged Hudson and Weaver to extract him from Rebirth Island before he would be killed by Dragovich's men (who were killing those who were not important anymore), but was shot and killed by Mason despite his attempt to jog Mason's memory. Steiner is voiced by Mark Bramhall.

*{{flagicon|Cuba}}  '''[[Prime Minister of Cuba]] [[Fidel Castro]]''' is a minor antagonist in the campaign, though serves as a protagonist in one version of the Zombie mode. He was Mason's target during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, though Mason only killed Castro's body double. His soldiers then captured Mason and handed him over to Dragovich. He later appears in the Pentagon fighting zombies alongside [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Richard Nixon]]. He is voiced by Marlon Correa and Gustavo Rex.

* † {{flagicon|UK}} '''Doctor Daniel Clarke''' is a cynical British communist and defector who left for the Soviet Union in 1964. His experience in Biology and chemistry, gained at [[Oxford University]], made him a useful tool to Dragovich in stabilizing the volatile compounds which made up Nova 6. Knowing that Dragovich would kill him as soon as Nova 6 was weaponized, he escaped to [[Kowloon City]] in Hong Kong, though was captured by Hudson and Weaver, who tortured him to try to weed out information. During their attempted escape, just before he could tell Hudson what the numbers from Dragovich's broadcast station meant, he was shot in the head and fell from the rooftops. Clarke is voiced by Gary Oldman.

*{{flagicon|USSR}} '''"Numbers"''' is an unnamed female character who broadcasts the number sequences to the Soviet sleeper agents in America from an unknown location. She is first seen when the game starts for the first time and in the ending of the game, and she can also be heard in Mason's head throughout the campaign. She is voiced (and played by in live action shots) by [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]].

===Zombies===
*{{flagicon|US}} '''Tank Dempsey''' is a fearless, stereotypical American war hero, a US Marine who is obsessed with war and bloodshed.  He hates Richtofen, and likes Takeo and  Nikolai. Tank Dempsey was also awarded for his bravery on the island of Peleliu during World War Two. Not one of the original super soldier test subjects, Dempsey was captured and tortured by Richtofen while trying to extract a spy from Group 935. He replaced a Mexican killed by Richtofen, and like the others, had his memory wiped, which he slowly starts to regain. Dempsey can be heard yelling insults and jokes at the zombies if the player accumulates a large amount of kills. Dempsey bears resemblance to Pvt. Polonsky, a non-playable U.S. Marine in ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]''. He is voiced by [[Steven Blum]].

*{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} '''Nikolai Belinski''' (Russian: '''Николай Белинский''') is a stereotypical Russian. A drunken, ignorant ex-soldier from the Red Army. He has had 6 wives, all of them killed by him, and he is obsessed with [[vodka]]. He respects Dempsey, but hates Takeo and he likes Richtofen until the map "Moon". He was one of the original super soldiers captured and tortured by Richtofen, the result of which was him being reduced to being nearly functionless without vodka. Nikolai can also be heard yelling non-sense about various things, mostly about his vodka he thinks the zombies are trying to steal. Belinski seems to look like Pvt. Chernov, a non-playable Red Army Soldier in [[Call of Duty: World at War]]. He is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].

*{{flagicon|Japan}} '''Takeo Masaki''' is former soldier in the Imperial Army from a long line of distinguished warriors. As such, he is concerned with his and his allies honor in battle. He likes Dempsey, respects Richtofen however holds a grudge towards him and hates Nikolai. He is the first to begin regaining his memories after Richtofen. Out of the three super soldiers, he is the only one who does not hate Richtofen. Masaki looks like the Japanese Officer in the starting sequence of [[Call of Duty: World at War]]. He is voiced by [[Tom Kane]].

*{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} '''Edward Richtofen''' A German ex-scientist who worked for Dr. Ludvig Maxis and his daughter Samantha and is the main anti-hero in the Zombies storyline. He was driven insane, possibly schizophrenic, by his encounter with an alien device called the "M.P.D." Maxis created the Hellhounds, Richtofen used them to kill Maxis and group 935, although  the daughter, Samantha, survived, and was sent to the Group 935 facility on the Moon. He has created the Wunderwaffe DG-2 and the Quantum Entanglement Device, or the QED. He hates Dempsey yet he seems to like Nikolai and Takeo. In Call of the Dead, he retrieves the Golden Rod from the celebrities, and in Shangri-La he obtains the Focusing Stone, which both play a part in his plan on the Moon. He uses both items to switch places with Samantha - who had been held prisoner inside the M.P.D. - and has been using Takeo, Nikolai, and Dempsey to achieve this, to become the master of all zombies to conquer the world. However, his plan is thwarted when the others follow Maxis' contingency plan to destroy the Earth and all zombies on it, leaving Richtofen in control of only the surviving zombies on the Moon, which are already being killed by the other three. He is voiced by [[Nolan North]].

*{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} '''Samantha Maxis''' is the 8-year-old daughter of Dr. Ludvig Maxis and the secondary antagonist of the Zombies campaign. With her father, she was trapped in a teleporter room with a hellhound. Instead of dying, she was sent to Griffin Station on the Moon. From there, she entered the "M.P.D.", gaining control of the zombies. Her efforts to destroy Dempsey, Nikolai, Takeo, and Richtofen are her completing her father's dying wish: to destroy everyone who betrayed them, including anyone helping said people. She has attacked the four with hellhounds, zombies, and space monkeys. She lured Yuri Kravcheski, a scientist, into trapping Dr. Gersch in the Kassimir Mechanism, leading to the map Ascension's greatest easter egg. In Moon, it is revealed that all the previous easter eggs in the other maps were part of Richtofen's plan to switch souls with her, so he could control the zombies. After accomplishing the plan, she ends up in Richtofen's physical body, while he ends up in her place, a spirit who controls the zombies.

*{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} '''Dr. Ludvig Maxis''' Samantha's father and the primary antagonist of the Zombies campaign he was the head of Group 935, and Richtofen's superior before Richtofen betrayed him by locking him and Sam in a room with the teleporter and a newly created Hellhound, which was Samantha's pregnant dog Fluffy. He survived, and was taken to the Moon by Richtofen's allies. His final request to Samantha was to destroy those who betrayed them, before being shot in the head. He later appeared as some sort of computer file denying access to Richtofen at Moon. However, Maxis is deleted by Richtofen just before he can stop him from receiving the Vril Generator from the computer. Later, just as the original characters and Samantha, now in Richtofen's body, he appears in a radio message and tells them to launch 3 rockets in order to kill all the zombies, stopping Richtofen's plan for an army of zombies to conquer Earth.

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[President of the United States]] [[John F. Kennedy]]''' is the first player character in one version of the Zombie mode. He made only one formal appearance in the campaign, during his meeting with Alex Mason to authorize Nikita Dragovich's assassination, though his voice plays over some parts of the game. He was assassinated in 1963, allegedly by Lee Harvey Oswald, though Mason appears to have had some form of involvement in the assassination, but it turned out that it was actually the zombies who killed Kennedy (at the end of the game) while the other three characters somehow escaped.

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]]''' is the second player character in one version of the Zombie mode. Like Kennedy, he only formally appears once in the campaign with his voice dubbed in other sections as well. He brings Alex Mason to Kennedy and helps to conspire to assassinate Nikita Dragovich. He is voiced by Robert Picardo.

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[Richard Nixon]]''' is the third character in the same version of Zombies as Kennedy and MacNamara. While he makes no formal appearance in the campaign, he is revealed to be in this mode because Kennedy believes that he could bring helpful ideas to ease the tensions between the U.S. and Cuba. He also appears to be a source of comic relief similar to that of Takeo Masaki in the majority of other zombies maps.

*{{flagicon|Cuba}} '''[[Prime Minister of Cuba]] [[Fidel Castro]]''' is the fourth character in the Zombies mode featuring the three characters mentioned prior. He appears in the campaign during the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and appears in Zombies while trying to negotiate peace talks with the U.S. after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]''' is the first playable character in the "Call of the Dead" mode of Zombies. She is one of the few women in the entire ''Call of Duty Series'' (and one of the even fewer playable ones.)  She is one of the four survivors on the set of a movie that was attacked by zombies and had helped Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, Edward Richtofen, and Takeo Masaki transfer themselves from a closet on the set into [[Shangri-La]]. Like the other characters in "Call of the Dead", she has no relevance to the actual campaign.

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[Robert Englund]]''' is the second playable character in "Call of the Dead". During the opening, he is made out to be the butt of a joke involving how to hit a zombie with a shotgun. He, like Gellar, is one of the four survivors of the zombie invasion on the movie set. During the opening, he is shown killing zombies with a pitchfork; however, it somehow vanishes when the game begins (Englund brings this up if a player buys the "Sickle" to replace your knife).

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[Danny Trejo]]''' is the third playable character in "Call of the Dead" and one of the four survivors on the film set. Like Englund, he has weapons in the opening that disappear when the game begins. In his case, they are dual wielded machete's though he never brings it up.

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[Michael Rooker]]''' is the fourth playable character in "Call of the Dead" and the fourth survivor on the film set. He, like Trejo and Englund, wields an unusable weapon in the opening (in his case they are dual double-barreled shotguns that fire three rounds before needing to be reloaded).

*{{flagicon|US}} '''[[George A. Romero]]''' is the main antagonist of "Call of the Dead". While directing a movie, he is abducted by zombies and injected with [[Element 115]]. He chases the playable characters around with a spotlight and becomes increasingly difficult the closer one gets to defeating him. If you hit him he goes into a berserk sprint and will not stop until he reaches water. It is assumed that he is either cured or the Element eventually wore off as he gives a speech at the end of the level.

====Player Characters====

<!-- Do not add any Special Ops related in this section. -->
*{{flagicon|UK}} '''[[Captain Price|Captain John Price]]''' ({{voiced by|[[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]}}) - A supporting character of the [[Modern Warfare 3|game]] until Soap's death when he becomes the main protagonist, is responsible for keeping the stability of his team, though he is not playable until the game's final mission, ''"Dust to Dust"''. He is emotionally attached to Soap as his "blood brother", due to his heavy respect towards him, and he experienced great irascibility towards Yuri after Soap's death. Price manages to track down Makarov to a hotel in the Middle East, and he and Yuri assault the hideout. Price eventually manages to wrap a cable around Makarov's neck and smash a glass window, sending him plunging to his death. Price then calmy smokes a cigar at the scene.

* † {{flagicon|UK}} '''Captain [[John Soap MacTavish|John "Soap" MacTavish]]''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|k|ˈ|t|æ|v|ɪ|ʃ}}; {{voiced by|[[Kevin McKidd]]}}) - He is a [[supporting character]] of the game. He is not a playable character, but the game's view is switched to his perspective during the opening of the game, similar that of to President Al-Fulani from ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare|Call of Duty 4]]'', which counts Soap as "playable" in some way. He was badly [[wikt:wounded|wounded]] after [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2#Plot|killing Lt. General Shepherd]] by launching a [[throwing knife]] into his eye in ''Modern Warfare 2''. However, he joins the player on most missions involving Yuri and is deemed as a very important role in running the game's storyline smoothly.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} He is killed when his attempt with Price,Yuri and Kamarov to assassinate Makarov fails, and an explosion resulted in him falling from a great height. Despite Price and Yuri's attempt to save him, he eventually dies from his injuries, with his dying words being "Makarov...knows...Yuri," leading to Captain Price's anguish. Captain Price then punched Yuri down the staircase and demanded to know of his association with Makarov.

* † {{flagicon|Russia}} '''Yuri''' (Russian: '''Юрий''') ({{voiced by|[[Brian Bloom]]}}) - The main playable character.

Yuri and Makarov were present when Zakhaev was shot by Price in [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]], where the two evacuated their leader from the arms deal. Yuri was also with Makarov in the Middle East, when the latter detonated the [[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare|nuclear bomb that killed 30,000 American soldiers]]. This made Yuri uneasy about Makarov's intentions. When Makarov and the other terrorists planned to do a masscare in Zakhaev International Airport, Yuri attempted to contact the F.S.B. to warn them, but was found out and shot by Makarov for treason. Yuri then tried to stop the massacre, but he passed out from blood loss. However, Yuri was rescued by members of the Russian Police, and vowed for revenge on Makarov.<ref name="friendallybetrayer">{{Cite video game  | title = '''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'''| developer = [[Infinity Ward]], [[Sledgehammer Games]]| publisher = [[Activision]]| date = November 8, 2011|platform = [[Playstation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Act 2 - "Blood Brothers" | quote =

After the events of "No Russian", he managed to declare a war on the U.S. to avenge the death of the citizens killed during the airport massacre.

* {{flagicon|USA}} '''Abigail "Misty" Briarton''' was a car mechanic and often thinks of herself as superior to all the other characters leaving suggest she is a [[narcissistic]], She is very fond of Marlton. She favors automatic weapons and dislikes semi-automatic weapons. Misty also seems to have a fondness for shotguns. Misty seems to alternate the role of leader with Russman, and inspires the group to fight on to Angola. Depending on the player's choices, Misty either dies by Maxis' hand, or is presumably killed by zombies at the end of Buried. She is voiced by [[Stephanie Lemelin]].

* {{flagicon|USA}} '''Marlton Johnson''' is a Caucasian man in his twenties. He wears a white collared shirt, blue jeans, and glasses. His actions and quotes in-game classify him as your typical "[[nerd]]" and Marlton has a very high view of himself, as he references the fact that he is an "indisputable genius" which sound like he is also another narcissistic like Misty or he just being arrogant. He does not get along with Russman and Samuel, and is only kind towards Misty. Depending on the player's choices, Marlton is either presumably killed by zombies or by Maxis' destruction of the Earth after the end of Buried. His character resembles the character from the horror film, "The Hills Have Eyes". He is voiced by [[Scott Menville]].

* {{flagicon|USA}} '''Samuel J. Stuhlinger''' is a somewhat overweight Caucasian man with a mustache and wears a green vest, khaki shorts, and glasses. He is incredibly paranoid and often suggesting that simple occurrences, such as running low on ammunition, are linked to a conspiracy of some sorts. He is infected with Element 115 and also the only character in the map that is able to hear Richtofen. In the map "Die Rise" cutscene, he talks to Richtofen and it is revealed he has eaten Zombie flesh, being a former member of a Zombie-eating cult called The Flesh. He escapes with Marlton and Misty, watching Russman sacrifice himself to save him, but he continues to talk to Richtofen which the other two don't realize.  A time warp happens bringing the group, with Russman back to the start of the map. By the time of Buried, the others are aware of his contact with Richtofen. If Maxis is victorious, Samuel is presumably killed during the destruction of the Earth while Maxis journeys to Agartha. If Richtofen succeeds, Samuel ends up becoming the physical host for Richtofen's soul, however, the German is unable to wrest full control and finds his return to a mortal form unpleasant nonetheless. He suffers [[Schizophrenia]] much as Richtofen did before him. He also likes food, especially cheese. He is voiced by [[David Boat]].

* {{flagicon|USA}} '''Russman''' is an elderly African-American man with white hair, wearing a brown trench coat and jeans.

By Die Rise, he becomes aware of the voice in Samuel's head. He leads the group from Shanghai to Angola, to find answers to the questions they've been plagued by since the zombie apocalypse began. Russman like the others is presumably killed by either the zombies if Richtofen succeeds, or by the destruction of the Earth at Maxis' hands. He is voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]].

* {{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} '''Edward Richtofen''' is a sociopath and a sadistic Nazi scientist who was a playable character in [[Call of Duty: Black Ops]] and the main anti-hero in the game mode. Richtofen previously worked as senior assistant to Dr. Ludvig Maxis, however his insanity and lust for power led him to betraying him by attempting to kill Maxis and his daughter, Samantha, then enter the Aether to gain control of the zombies. The plan faltered, and instead Samantha herself entered the Aether while Maxis encased his soul in the computers of Richtofen's moon base, Griffin Station. Eventually, Richtofen was able to teleport himself back to the moon during the Black Ops map of the same name, and use a Vril Generator and supply of Element 115 to switch souls with Samantha, thereby entering the Aether and gaining control of the zombies. Maxis then enacted his emergency plan should this occur and launched three nuclear missiles at the Earth to fracture Edward's connection with the undead forces located there, though the plan had little effect. Richtofen later enlisted the help of four survivors on Earth to activate three polarization devices to open a dimensional rift that would allow him to gain full manipulation of the zombie forces. If the player heeds Richtofen's command, he succeeds in making the Earth his plaything, kills Maxis, and makes Samuel his new physical host, but cannot grasp full control of his new body and finds the experience unpleasant thanks to the threat of the zombies and Samuel's poor hygiene. If the player heeds Maxis, he takes control of the Aether and banishes Richtofen to become a blue-eyed zombie for all eternity, and is presumably killed like the others when Maxis destroys the Earth. He is voiced by [[Nolan North]].

* {{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} '''Dr. Ludvig Maxis''' is the true main antagonist of the Zombies storyline, the lead scientist part of the project known as "[[Die Glocke]]" and is the father of Samantha Maxis. During World War II Maxis led the Nazi-allied Group 935 investigating in the recently discovered Element 115, however was betrayed by Richtofen, his senior assistant, who plotted he and his daughter's deaths. Before death, he urged Samantha to use the zombie army he created to kill Group 935 for their betrayal, and was able to assume an AI-rendered form in the computer system of Griffin Station upon being shot. During the events of the Black Ops map "Moon", Maxis enlisted the help of Tank, Nikolai, Takeo and Samantha in enacting his plan after Richtofen gained control of the Aether's energy, to fire three nuclear missiles at the Earth to sever its link with the Aether. The plan failed, and Richtofen kept a fragile connection with the zombie hordes, forcing Maxis to turn to his plan B. Depending on the choices of the player, Misty, Russman, Marlton, and Samuel activate three global polarization devices to collect the energy contained in matter to open a rift to the Aether, allowing him to take control. Maxis then revealed that rather than heal the Earth as he promised, he intended to destroy it as it was necessary to open the gateway to Agartha, where he believed Samantha was located. If the player activates the towers in Richtofen's favor, Richtofen kills Maxis upon taking ultimate control of the Aether. He is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].
