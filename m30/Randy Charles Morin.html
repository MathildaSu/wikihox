'''Randy Charles Morin''' is a Canadian web publisher and the former chairman of the [[RSS Advisory Board]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/3388/randy-charles-morin-becomes-rss-advisory |title=Randy becomes Chairman of RSS}}</ref>, a group that publishes the [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] 2.0 specification. Randy authored the [http://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery RSS autodiscovery specification] and contributed to the [http://www.rssboard.org/rss-profile RSS profile]. He also runs the [[TalkSports]] website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/11752403/athletes-personal-lives-big-business|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2017|title=Athletes' dating lives are big business|publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

Morin began TalkSports after a 2005 blog post he wrote about hockey player [[Sidney Crosby]] received a comment from a female inquiring whether Crosby had a girlfriend.
