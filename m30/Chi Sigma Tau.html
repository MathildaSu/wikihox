We the men of Chi Sigma Tau, in eternal brotherhood, pledge ourselves to the development of character within each member. We shall encourage and reward academic excellence, promote service in our communities, and educate ourselves and the community around us on issues regarding Asian American culture, history, and identity. By continued involvement in our fraternity, leadership is not only a trait acquired, it is a skill that is mastered, that each brother will carry with themselves far beyond their college years. Although we are an Asian Interest fraternity, it is the strong policy of Chi Sigma Tau to make all membership-related decisions without regard to age, race, or religion.<ref name=history/>
