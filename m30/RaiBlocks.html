'''RaiBlocks''' or '''XRB''' is a [[peer-to-peer]] [[cryptocurrency]] and open source software project similar to [[bitcoin]] (BTC) and is designed to be a low latency, high throughput cryptocurrency that features instant transaction confirmation. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRB doesn't require any special hardware to mine but instead it is distributed through its faucet based on human work provided by claiming and solving [[captcha]] which makes it unique.
As of May 2017, it is the 197th largest crytpocurrency according to [[market capitalization]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coinmarketcap.com/2 |title=Crypto-Currency Market Capitalizations |publisher=coinmarketcap.com |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref>

== History ==
RaiBlocks is pronounced like "ray blocks" and is named after Rai Stones, it was released on May 1, 2014 from its official faucet. Initially the project was started by Colin LeMahieu who designed the algorithm for this cryptocurrency. Other note-able developers in the project includes mikerow	Web developer, sergsw/byte16 Network supporter, Timothy Redaell Building supporter. Raiblocks uses the [[BLAKE2]] hashing algorithm.
On May 2, 2017 the marketcap of Raiblocks crossed $1 million for the first time as its price was also recorded to be the all time high. Since then both its price and marketcap are continuously soaring which is helping it to improve its ranking among other cryptocurrencies in the market.

==Distribution==
The distribution of Raiblocks is based on human based work by solving captcha. Each hour a fixed number of 17000 MXRB is released from the faucet which is distributed among top 60 claimers according to this formula :
top-account reward = top-account claims / total top-accounts claims * max quantity distributed
so as the number of claimers increase the mining difficulty of the coin also increases which results in less reward per claim. As of 20 May 2017, over 100,000 people have been claiming mrai from its faucet daily.

==Divider==
Raiblocks uses 128 bit integer to represent account balances, a set of SI prefixes to make the numbers more accessible and avoid confusion. The reference wallet uses Mrai as a divider.

==Exchanges==
Raiblock currently has 2 exchanges, Bitgrail and Mercatox. Bitgrail is a dedicated raiblocks exchange while in the past it was also being exchanged on cryptopia. Another big cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex has been also considering to adopt Raiblocks. At most of the exchanges XRB is being traded for [[Bitcoin]] BTC but on bitgrail it can also be traded for other coins such as [[Dogecoin]] DOGE and [[litecoin]] LTC
