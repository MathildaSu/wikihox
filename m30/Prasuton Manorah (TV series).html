==Plot==
After the death of Meri (Thai: เมรี) and Rodhasen (Thai: รถเสน), their spirits flew away to the Next life. Many years later,
Rodhasen reincarnated as a young prince called Phra Suthon. (Thai: พระสุธน) One day, Phra Suthon was visited by Phran Boon (Thai: พรานบุญ). Phran Boon presented him with a young beautiful girl called Manohra (Thai: มโนห์รา). Manohra was a magical bird-human whom Phran Boon caught during his hunting in the deep forest. She was the reincarnation of Meri. Phra Suthon and Manohra got married and lived a happy life but things changed when a lord of a kings' court was jealous of Phra Suthon. He tricked Phra Suthon into leaving the Kingdom and lied to the King that Manohra brought bad luck to the Kingdom. He told the king that the only way to chase away the bad luck was to burn Manohra alive. Manohra survived by asking the King for her wings, so that she could dance in his presence before she died and when she got her wings back, she flew away to Khao Krailas (Thai: เขาไกรลาส), her home where she was the youngest daughter of the ruler.  When Phra Suthon came back to the Kingdom, he was very sad and was determined that he had to bring Manohra back. Phra Suthon journeyed in the forest for 7 years 7 months and 7 days, faced several challenges and fought a lot of monsters before he arrived in Khao Krailas where the last challenge awaited for him. Phra Suthon had to identify Manohra from her six sisters who had been charmed to look exactly like Manohra. Phra Suthon identified the right Manhora with the help of God [[Indra]] who disguised as a golden fly and flew above Manohra's head. After that, Phra Suthon brought Manohra back to his Kingdom and they lived happily till the end of their days.
