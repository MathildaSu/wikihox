===Paperlessness===

==Works==

===BMW i3 Become Electric===

Idea Rebel and Tool of North America collaborated on an app called Become Electric that puts the user in the drivers seat of BMW's electric car.
The app was developed using a video filmed with a 360º camera, creating an immersive 3D world in which the device is a user's window into a panoramic movie. The user drives the action, while interacting with the car’s features, and discovering more about the innovative new BMW i3 Range.<ref>Gabriel Nica, [http://www.autoevolution.com/bmw-blog/bmw-presents-become-electric-the-best-app-ever-made-video-69598.html "BMQ Presents Become Electric, The best app ever made"], ''Auto Evolution'',10.24.2013</ref>

===Yokohama===

Idea Rebel developed web content for tire manufacturer Yokohama. A custom WordPress build, the multilingual site features a tire selector tool, product cataloger, dealer locator, technology and design resources and a motor sports section highlighting Yokohama's links to racing.<ref>[http://yokohama.ca/yokohama-launches-new-website-engage-educate-consumers/ Article in Yokohama]</ref>
