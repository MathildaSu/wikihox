'''OC&C Strategy Consultants''' is a [[management consulting]] firm that provides strategic advice to senior management in large corporations and organisations. It now employs over 500 consultants and has over 80 Partners. It is one of few European-founded strategy firms to have reached scale in an otherwise US-dominated industry.

==History==

OC&C was founded in 1987 in London by Chris Outram<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.occstrategy.com/about-occ/partners/united-kingdom/chris-outram | title = Chris Outram biography}}</ref> and Geoff Cullinan, who were both Partners at the time with [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz Allen & Hamilton]]. After several years at other consulting firms, they had tired of the fact that their employers devoted so much time to operational issues while neglecting strategic analysis. They then decided it would be “more fun and more challenging” to start their own firm.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/companies/company-profile/OC&C-Strategy-Consultants-Asia?companyId=9989623 | title = OC&C Strategy Consultants Asia}}</ref> In the same year, the German consultancy  “S. & K. und Partner” was founded in Duesseldorf  by Dr. Gerd Schnetkamp and Dr. Hans-Dieter Kleinhueckelskoten, both previously with McKinsey, which subsequently rebranded and joined the OC&C firm. An office opened in Paris in 1989 and another opened in Rotterdam in 1992, founded respectively by Philippe Kaas and Pieter Witteveen,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.occstrategy.com/about-occ/partners/benelux/pieter-witteveen | title = Pieter Witteveen biography}}</ref> both previously Partners in the local McKinsey offices. Several further offices have been added since.

To gain greater access to the American market, OC&C merged with Boston-based Callidon Group in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://analyticsstrategy.com/what/merger/default.aspx | title = OC&C Strategy Consultants – Callidon Merger}}</ref> Over recent years, the firm has successfully opened offices in India (New Delhi and Mumbai) and China (Shanghai and Hong Kong), taking OC&C into the fastest growing markets in the world.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/companies/company_gold_pages/OC&C-Strategy-Consultants?companyId=27913&detail=ScoopDetail | title = OC&C Strategy Consultants - The Scoop}}</ref> According to the Vault.com career guide, soon after establishing footprint in Asia, the majority of clients served by the OC&C Chinese offices are leading multinational companies and some of the region's top players. The Indian offices focus almost exclusively on board-level work with the top companies in the country, multinationals, major private equity houses and occasionally smaller companies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/companies/company-profile/OC&C-Strategy-Consultants-Asia?companyId=9989623 | title = OC&C Strategy Consultants Asia}}</ref>

== Recruitment & Comparison to Competitors ==

OC&C typically accepts applications from the world’s elite universities and institutions, putting less of an emphasis on discipline studied and more on a demonstrable aptitude for creative and lateral thinking and the applicant’s fit within the company’s culture. The interviewing and selection process generally ranges across four to six interviews over two to three rounds. Additionally, OC&C operates an annual international strategy workshop, which brings together 24 “outstanding international students from different academic backgrounds”, to work on a business strategy case. OC&C later employs those who perform well throughout the workshop.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.weknowyoucan.com/the-event/ | title = International Strategy Workshop}}</ref>

OC&C was ranked 6th in the Vault Consulting 25 for 2011,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/rankings/individual?rankingId1=261&rankingId2=-1&rankings=1&regionId=1000&rankingYear=2011 | title = Vault Rankings}}</ref> combining Vault's "Best to Work For" ranking with overall prestige. OC&C's high rates of pay and positioning as an alternative to McKinsey, Accenture, Bain and BCG makes them an attractive proposition to potential recruits.

OC&C's commitment to gender equality is exemplified by Anita Balchandani, one of the firm's London partners, who is currently a member of the advisory panel of Women2Win - an organisation whose aim is to increase the number of women in parliament.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.women2win.com/get-involved | title = Women2Win - Get Involved}}</ref>

== Publications & Events ==

OC&C regularly publishes analyses regarding its core business areas.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.occstrategy.com/our-thinking | title = OC&C Strategy Consultants - Our Thinking}}</ref> In addition to these unique publications, the firm also publishes annual industry reviews, which include:

*FMCG Global 50 (in association with [[The Grocer]] and various other publications in other geographies)

*UK Retail Christmas Trading Index (in association with [[Retail Week]])

*UK Facilities Management Index (in association with FM World)

*Media Index (in association with [[The Guardian]])

*European Credit Management and Debt Collection Index (In association with Credit Today)

<br />
Additionally, the firm published a book with [[John Wiley & Sons]] Press, titled "The Craft of Strategy Formation",<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470518596,descCd-authorInfo.html | title = The Craft of Strategy Formation: Translating Business Issues into Actionable Strategies - Author Information}}</ref> which explains the "steps to take (and pitfalls to watch out for) when typically vague business concerns need to be translated into actionable strategy fast"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470518596,descCd-description.html | title = The Craft of Strategy Formation: Translating Business Issues into Actionable Strategies - Description}}</ref>

OC&C organises and co-sponsors several high profile industry events, such as the [[World Retail Congress]], which is the largest international meeting place for retail leaders;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldretailcongress.com/sponsors.cfm | title = Partners & Sponsors - World Retail Congress}}</ref> the Media and Telco (Year) & Beyond annual conference, a summit which addresses trends, ideas and opportunities in the media industry;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mediaandtelco.com/2011andbeyond/ | title = Media and Telco 2011 & Beyond}}</ref> and various other events in other specialist sectors e.g. education.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.educationinvestor.co.uk/Seminars/EducationTechnology.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 | title = Great expectations: Can education technology really deliver?}}</ref>

== Corporate Social Responsibility ==

The OC&C London office has worked with the [[Impetus Trust]], pioneers in venture philanthropy, since 2004. During that time, OC&C teams have worked on a pro bono basis on numerous strategic projects for charities and social enterprises in the Impetus portfolio. These charities include B-Eat, Bulky Bob’s, Fairtrade, the Furniture Resource Centre, IntoUniversity, Keyfund, Leap Confronting Conflict, the Prison Radio Association, Riders for Health, St. Giles Trust and Street League. These projects are done with a full, professional team, the same way as commercial projects are done, but entirely unpaid for.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.impetus.org.uk/get-involved/contribute-skills/hear-from-our-corporate-partners/ | title = Impetus UK - Hear from our Corporate Partners}}</ref>

OC&C’s other offices also conduct pro bono work: for example, the [[Benelux]] office recently undertook a project for the leading Dutch Multiple Sclerosis charity to develop a new direction and funding strategy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/companies/company_gold_pages/OC&C-Strategy-Consultants?companyId=27913&detail=ScoopDetail | title = OC&C Strategy Consultants - The Scoop}}</ref>
