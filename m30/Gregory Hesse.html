'''Gregory Hesse''', [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|S.T.D.]], [[Doctor of Canon Law|J.C.D.]] of [[Vienna]], Austria was ordained in 1981 in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. He held doctorates in both Thomistic theology and [[Canon Law]]. From 1986-88 he served as Secretary to [[Alfons Maria Stickler|Cardinal Stickler]] at the Vatican. From 1991, he worked in Austria, Germany and the United States giving lectures and producing theological articles that appeared in ''[[Catholic Family News]]'', ''The Fatima Crusader'' and other journals. He died of complications due to [[diabetes]] on 25 January 2006.

Fr. Hesse spoke extensively on the true and false understanding of [[Papal infallibility]] and the modern errors in the understanding of sacred tradition, religious liberty and ecumenism brought about by the errors or obscurity and lack of definition in the documents of Vatican II based on established Church teaching from previous councils and Papal encyclicals. He also spoke on the question of the new Mass of Pope Paul VI making distinctions between the terms "valid" and "licit" again supported by past Church teaching.
