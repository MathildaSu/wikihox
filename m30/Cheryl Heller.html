== Involvement with Non-Profit Organizations ==

She is an advisor to Design for the Other 90%, an NGO led by [[Paul Polak]], and helped to create a related exhibit at the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum.

In 2008, Heller launched "Good Brand Camp", a one-day workshop for nonprofit organizations and social entrepreneurs to help them accomplish their missions by developing powerful brand strategies and communication systems.

"The growing number of mission-driven organizations has brought with it a more intense level of competition for support and attention", Heller said. "Over the years, we’ve worked mostly with for-profit companies, helping them strengthen their messages and methods of delivery. We felt it was time to share this experience with as many nonprofit organizations as possible by developing this 'almost free' workshop."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/News/12711.html |title=Heller Launches "Good Brand Camp" – Inspires Mission-Driven Organizations to Redefine Message in Current Competitive Climate – Press Releases on |publisher=Csrwire.com |date=2008-07-23 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>
