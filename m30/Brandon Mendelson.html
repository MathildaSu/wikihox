== Career ==

=== Advocacy ===
In 2008, Mendelson established a [[Twitter]] account to bring awareness to the fight against breast cancer. He was drawn to this issue through the health crises of both of his grandmothers.<ref name="crunchbase1">{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/b-j-mendelson |title=B.J. Mendelson &#124; CrunchBase Profile |publisher=Crunchbase.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> His account was then placed on the [[Twitter]] Suggested User List in February 2009. When Twitter and Mendelson began promoting the "Kicking Breast Cancer's Butt Across America Tour" on his Twitter account, it resulted in an increase of approximately 5,000 followers a day.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|author= De La Cruz, Ralph |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-02-12/news/0902110586_1_breast-cancer-tour-web-sites |title=Couple's trip to raise cancer awareness is also a virtual journey |publisher=Sun Sentinel |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> He offered to sell his spot on the Suggested User List to entrepreneur [[Jason Calacanis]] in exchange for the $250,000 Calacanis offered Twitter for a spot on the list. The exchange between Calacanis and Mendelson was blocked by Twitter co-founders [[Ev Williams]] and [[Biz Stone]].<ref name="crunchbase1" /> The funds would have been donated to the 1 in 8 Foundation, with whom Mendelson organized the national tour to bring awareness to the fight against breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fuggetta, Emily |url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_c7a25aa0-ef7a-582e-8543-611479d196e2.html |title=Nonprofit organization raises breast cancer awareness|publisher=The Independent Florida Alligator |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/20/hey-twitter-heres-a-way-to-call-jasons-bluff-and-maybe-fight-breast-cancer |title=Hey Twitter, Here's A Way To Call Jason's Bluff And Maybe Fight Breast Cancer |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Briggs |first=Bill |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27668152/ |title=Digital gold: Turning techno-junk into cash |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> He considered the national breast cancer awareness campaign and tour unsuccessful, attributing the failure to his initial marketing efforts that relied on social networking.

=== Writing ===
