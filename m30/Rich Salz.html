'''Rich Salz''' is a Principal Engineer at Akamai Technologies. 

His previous position was technical lead for the XML appliance products at [[IBM]].<ref>http://xmlsummerschool.com/faculty2009/richsalz/</ref> He came to IBM when he was [[Chief Security Officer]] of [[DataPower]], which was acquired by IBM in 2005.

He has made numerous contributions to recent work on [[XML]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[SOAP]] specifications,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} particularly involving security.

For many years, he spelled his name 'Rich $alz' (see [[Talk:Rich Salz]] for an explanation) and was an early contributor to the [[free software movement]].  In 1986 he replaced [[John P. Nelson]] as editor of the original "[[moderated newsgroup|moderated]]" [[Usenet]] group for free source code, mod.sources<ref>{{cite newsgroup
  | title = Many newsgroup postings
  | author =
  | date =
  | newsgroup = mod.sources
  | id =
  | url = http://groups.google.com/group/mod.sources
  | accessdate =  2006-11-18}}</ref> (later renamed to comp.sources.unix<ref>{{cite newsgroup

</ref>). This [[newsgroup]] was a primary distribution medium for high quality free software before Internet access became available to the public.  Salz posted early releases of [[Patch (Unix)|patch]], [[localtime]], [[perl]], [[Concurrent Versions System|cvs]], [[Elm (e-mail client)|elm]], and the first free [[Tar (file format)|tar]] program.
He passed the job of editor to [[Paul Vixie]] in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  He also wrote free software, including porting [[AberMUD]] to [[UNIX]] in 1989 and the original release of the well-respected and still-used [[InterNetNews|INN]],<ref>https://www.isc.org/software/inn/</ref> which became the de facto software for running [[Usenet]] [[news server]]s, for a few years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
