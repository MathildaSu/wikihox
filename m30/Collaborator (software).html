'''Collaborator''' is a tool by [[SmartBear Software]] for development team collaboration through [[peer review]] of code, user stories and test plans. With it, developers can review each other’s code, product managers can review each other’s user stories, testers can review each other’s test plans – and each group can review the other’s materials.<ref>{{cite web

Collaborator is used primarily by large enterprises, particularly those with distributed teams that require enhanced collaboration and review.<ref>{{cite web

Collaborator is available for Windows, Linux, and [[Solaris (operating system)]] servers.

==Features==

'''Code & Document Review'''
Collaborator allows users to submit code and/or documents and Excel files to a group of reviewers. Reviewers make comments and identify defects in the code and/or documents. The author then modifies the code and/or documents and resubmits them for review. Reviewers can compare versions in a diff viewer. The process continues until all are satisfied with the code and/or document.

'''Asynchronous Reviews'''
With Collaborator, reviews happen asynchronously. And they happen on your time. So at night, while one of your authors of code in the U.S. is sleeping, one of your code reviewers in India can be reviewing their code. No meetings… and nothing to interrupt you from the work you’re doing!

'''Real-time Chat'''
Collaborator’s web-based "chat" interface acts just like an instant messenger. Whenever another user chats, your screen will automatically update in real-time – no need to refresh the screen.
User Threaded, Contextual Chat
Collaborator links file changes, chat conversations, and defects together in your code review. You can view each conversation, threaded by file and line number, simultaneously with file content. There’s no need to toggle back and forth between emails and editors. Choose between multiple views or download differences to your local machine for further inspection and testing. You can even hyperlink directly to a file or line numbers.

'''Review Checklists'''
Collaborator checklists ensure that potential vulnerabilities, either in code or documents, are properly identified, then addressed during review. They also provide an audit trail of who addressed each vulnerability and when.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/collaborator-smartbear-answers-call-powerful-120000113.html |title=New Collaborator by SmartBear Answers Call for Powerful Collaboration by Extending Award-Winning Capabilities for Testers, Quality Assurance Teams

'''Invite a Colleague to a Review Through Conversations'''
This optional feature allows any participant in a review to invite someone to that review by entering their email address in the comments section of the review.  The person whose email address was mentioned will receive an invitation by email to view the review. Depending on how Collaborator is configured, they may even be able to add themselves as a participant in the review.

'''Test and Diff Files Locally'''
With Collaborator, you can compare diffs. Download a ZIP file containing the latest contents of all files under review. Expand code into your development environment for manual testing, checking the build, and running unit tests. Or click a button to download all diffs and view in a local diff viewer such as DiffMerge or Araxis Merge.

'''Customizable and Automated Workflows'''
Customizable workflows and fields help ensure that Collaborator can be modified to your workflow rather than the other way around. Change the rules for the review depending on pre-defined, configurable review types and desired workflow. For example, a "Self Check" review might only require that the author look over his own files. A "Formal" review might require a moderator, author, one or more reviewers, and a recorder. Configurable roles allow you to specify expectations for each person in the review and control what each user can do and view.

'''Defect Tracking & Management'''
Find a problem, create a defect. This defect management feature helps you create defects using customizable fields so you can collect as much (or as little) data as you like. Once you log a defect, the software tracks it as part of the review and ensures all defects get addressed before review completion. Authors can correct defects and upload changes back to the review for verification. Even when line numbers shift as a result of a defect fix, Collaborator will thread all chat conversations and defects back to the correct logical line of code. Collaborator even shares the defect details with your Issue Tracking system, such as Bugzilla or FogBugz.

'''Easy Deployment & Administration'''
Collaborator adapts to your environment. Authenticate users internally or by using corporate LDAP or Active Directory. Manage privileges, activity, and monitor usage through intuitive metrics reports that detail inspection rates, defect rates, and more.

'''IDE & SCM Integrations'''
Collaborator integrates with 16 SCMs: AccuRev, CMVC, CVS, Git, Mercurial, MKS Integrity, Perforce, Rational ClearCase (including ClearCase Remote Client), Rational Synergy, Rational Team Concert, Subversion, StarTeam, Surround SCM, Team Foundation Server, Vault, and Visual Source Safe. Collaborator also integrates with Eclipse and Visual Studio.

'''Metrics & Reporting'''
Collaborator provides over 100 reports. Users can customize reports to show metrics like status of pending code reviews and detailed audit trails. View results on-line, print, or export as CSV files. Easily compute key metrics such as defect density, inspection rate, and defect detection rate so users can gauge team performance and improvement.

'''Regulatory & CMMI Compliance'''
Collaborator allows users to implement the standardized and documented peer review processes required for CMMI with centralized reporting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smartbear.com/products/software-development/code-review/code-review-tools/ |title=Review Code, Documents & Artifacts - Collaborator
