The Belarusian '''Black Cat''' partisans ({{lang-be|Чорны кот, Čorny Kot}}) was a [[Nazi Germany|German]]-trained [[Belarus]]ian nationalist and anti-Soviet [[guerrilla]] unit during [[World War II]]. It was a part of the German clandestine operation known as ''Liebes Kätzchen'' stretching from the Baltics to the Black Sea. The Belarusian Black Cat guerrilla group led by [[Michas' Vitushka]] was parachuted behind Soviet lines in late 1944. They operated in [[Belavezha Forest]] (Białowieża) throughout 1945 but with limited success.<ref name="PartyzanFilm">{{cite journal | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/201323579/BielaruskiRezystans-1 | title=Belarusian Resistance, documentary by PartyzanFilm 2008 (transcript) | publisher=Scribd.com | work=Based on Bialoruski ruch oporu by Siarhiej Jorsz | date=January 22, 2014 | accessdate=19 February 2015 | author=Dawid Wowra}}</ref><ref name="wilson109">Andrew Wilson (2011).

==History==
During the Soviet counteroffensive of 1944, special units of local Nazi [[collaborationist]]s were trained in Dahlwitz near [[Berlin]]{{fact|date=May 2016}} by ''[[SS-Standartenführer]]'' [[Otto Skorzeny]] to infiltrate the Soviet rear.<ref name="MI6"/> The paratroopers came from ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]''; and were split into commandos based on the country of origin. Latvian were called "Forest Cats", Ukrainians, "Steppe Cats", and the Belarusians, "Black Cats".<ref name="PartyzanFilm"/>  As part of the Nazi effort to combat the growing [[Belarusian resistance movement|Soviet partisan movement in Belarus]] during the war, some thirty Belarusians from the espionage and sabotage outfit known as "Čorny Kot" (''Black Cat'') led by [[Michał Vituška]] age 37, were [[airdrop]]ped by the [[Luftwaffe]] in late 1944 behind the lines of the [[Red Army]]. At that time, the German forces had already been expelled from the present-day Belarus during [[Operation Bagration]].

Black Cats experienced some initial successes due to disorganization in the rear of the Red Army. In the city of Minsk they engaged in gun robberies causing death.<ref name="Singer-Genis">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=JdGy7Ya4KCIC&q=%22Black+Cat%22#v=snippet&q=%22Black%20Cat%22&f=false | title=I Won't Die Hungry: A Holocaust Survivor's Memoir | publisher=AuthorHouse | work=Google eBook | date=2011 | accessdate=21 February 2015 | author=Alice Singer-Genis | page=67 | ISBN=1456736507}}</ref> Other German-trained Belarusian nationalist units also slipped through the [[Białowieża Forest]] in 1945. However, the [[NKVD]] secret police informants infiltrated these units. As the result, they were ambushed and killed in short order.<ref name="Dudar"/> Still, some armed anti-Soviet resistance continued in Belarus by mid-1950s. Vituška himself managed to escape to the West along with several other [[Belarusian Central Rada]] leaders, and the subsequent reports of his death differ greatly. According to some reports, he was killed in action on 7 January 1945 airdropped back behind the Soviet front. Other reports claim he was still alive in 1946.<ref name="kresy24.pl">S.
