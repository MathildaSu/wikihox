The [[2016 Major League Soccer season|2016 regular season]] match between [[Hudson River derby|derby rivals]] [[New York City FC]] and [[New York Red Bulls]] took place at [[Yankee Stadium]] on May 21, 2016. New York Red Bulls won the match 7–0, thereby tying the record for the largest away win and largest winning margin ever in the history of [[Major League Soccer]]. Five different players scored for the Red Bulls, and every substitute that came on for the Red Bulls scored a goal.<ref name="recap">{{cite web|title=New York City FC v New York Red Bulls|url=http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2016-05-21-new-york-city-fc-vs-new-york-red-bulls/recap|website=Major League Soccer|publisher=MLSSoccer.com|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> The match has since been dubbed with a multitude of nicknames, including the Hudson River Massacre, the Red (Bull) Wedding, and Siete a Cero.

== Background ==

New York City FC entered the match on a franchise-record five-match unbeaten streak, which included a club-record three-match winning streak. This included away victories at the defending MLS Cup champions, [[Portland Timbers]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Conwell|first1=William|title=Portland Timbers Lose 2-1 Again, This Time to New York City FC|url=http://www.stumptownfooty.com/2016/5/15/11680222/portland-timbers-lose-2-1-again-this-time-to-new-york-city-fc|website=Stumptown Footy|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=May 23, 2016|date=May 15, 2016}}</ref> defending [[Canadian Championship]] winners, [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]]<ref name="nycfc v vancouver">{{cite web|title=New York City 3 - 2 Vancouver Whitecaps|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/new-york-city-vs-vancouver/353468|website=Sky Sports|publisher=SkySports.com|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> as well as recent CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinalists, [[D.C.

The Red Bulls started the 2016 campaign as the defending [[Supporters' Shield]] winners, but suffered a 1–6–0 record to begin the season. However, the Red Bulls were entering the game in good form, coming off 1–0 home victory over [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], and having only one loss in their last five matches.

Ahead of the game itself, City had a +1 goal difference, and the Red Bulls had a &minus;6 goal difference. The Red Bulls were 15th overall, and sixth in the East, while City FC were 7th overall and 2nd in the East.

==Match==
Kickoff was originally scheduled for 3:00&nbsp;pm local, but was delayed to 3:35&nbsp;pm local time due to the FOX Sports broadcast of the [[2016 FA Cup Final]] going into extra time.<ref>{{cite web|title=FOX Sports on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/FOXSports/status/734088882245885953|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref> Chris Penso was the referee and his assistants were Chris Strickland and Eric Weisbrod. The fourth official was Mark Kadlecik. Two regular starters, [[Damien Perrinelle]] of the Red Bulls and [[Kwadwo Poku]] of City FC were not in the matchday squad due to injuries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2016-05-21-new-york-city-fc-vs-new-york-red-bulls/preview | title=New York City FC vs. New York Red Bulls | publisher=Major League Soccer | accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> The weather was cloudy with a temperature of {{convert|63|F|C}}.

===First half===
[[File:Bradley_Wright_Phillips_nyrb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bradley Wright-Phillips]] scored two of the Red Bulls' three first half goals]]

Red Bulls coach Marsch made a few adjustments from the team's midweek fixture at Chicago. [[Connor Lade]] started at left back over [[Kemar Lawrence]], and Lade's vacated right back posistion was filled by [[Sal Zizzo]]. The remaining nine players in the lineup played in the Wednesday match. The Red Bulls stuck to their same 4-2-3-1 formation. Kemar Lawrence was an unused sub during the match. City FC also played a midweek fixture, at Toronto, and had a handful of changes to their lineup. At left back, [[Rónald Matarrita]] started in the place of [[Diego Martínez (footballer, born 1992)|Diego Martínez]]. [[R. J. Allen]] replaced [[Ethan White]] to start at right back. [[Khiry Shelton]] started over [[Stiven Mendoza]], and [[Thomas McNamara (soccer)|Tommy McNamara]] started over [[Mehdi Ballouchy]], who was given the day off after playing on Wednesday. [[Patrick Vieira]] employed his usual 4-3-3 formation.

The first five minutes were overwhelmingly possessed by the Red Bulls, which led to the first goal of the match, three minutes in. A [[Sacha Kljestan]] corner connected with captain, [[Dax McCarty]] who, left unmarked, headed the ball in the middle right net, leaving little time for City FC goalie, [[Josh Saunders]] to react. The majority of the first half saw spells of possession for both sides, with City FC having more of the ball than the Red Bulls. In the 42nd minute, [[Mike Grella]] dribbled down the left flank and was able to successfully fend off [[Federico Bravo]] and [[R. J. Allen]], creating a cross that lead to a [[Bradley Wright-Phillips]] header. Wright-Phillips would shortly add a second goal to his personal tally just four minutes later, this time, off a bicycle kick into the bottom right corner, dipping beneath a diving Saunders. Grella, again on the left wing, played a cross into the box that was redirected by [[Aurélien Collin]] to Wright-Phillips.

===Second half===
Neither coach made any half time adjustments. A little over five minutes after the start of the second half the Red Bulls were awarded a corner, which Sacha Kljestan took once again - and found Dax McCarty for an identical header goal to make the score 4-0. With a comfortable lead, Jesse Marsch subbed off Mike Grella and brought on rookie forward Alex Muyl. Within two minutes of coming onto the pitch, Bradley Wright-Phillips centered the ball right to Muyl, who scored his first goal with the Red Bulls to make the score 5-0. At the 66th minute Wright-Phillips was subbed off and replaced with Gonzalo Veron.
In the 75th minute, [[Frank Lampard]] made his first appearance for City FC since the 2015 season and was jeered by his own fans while coming on for [[Andrea Pirlo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36352180|title=Lampard booed as New York City lose derby 7-0|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=21 May 2016|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref> At the 80th minute Marsch used his last substitute, taking off Sacha Kljestan and bringing on centre-back Gideon Baah in an effort to preserve the clean sheet. Several minutes later, Veron scored his first goal of the season with a header off a free kick from Felipe to make the score 6-0. A few minutes later, Gideon Baah made his first MLS goal to secure the 7-0 final score.
