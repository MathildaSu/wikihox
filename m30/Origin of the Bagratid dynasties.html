The '''Bagratid dynasties''' – '''[[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]]''' (Բագրատունյաց) in [[Armenia]] and '''[[Bagrationi]]''' (ბაგრატიონი) in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] – count among the longest-reigning royal families in the [[Caucasus]] (and in Europe), starting as princely houses and attaining to the royal status in both countries in the 9th century. The origins of the Bagratids are disputed though more widely accepted version has it that the both dynasties had common roots{{ciation needed|date=September 2014}}, beginning in Armenia and branching later into Georgia.<ref>Toumanoff, C., ''Iberia on the Eve of Bagratid Rule'', p.&nbsp;22, cited in: Suny (1994), p. 349</ref><ref>Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies in Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts and Eurasian Contexts'', p. 337</ref> The Armenian house went extinct by the 12th century, while the Georgian line, continues to this day. The root of the names [[Bagrationi]] and [[Bagratuni (disambiguation)|Bagratuni]], ''Bagrat-'', derives from the [[Old Persian]] ''Bagadāta'', "God-Given". In Armenia and Georgia, the respective names for the Bagratid dynasties literally translate to "The children of/house established by [[Bagrat]]" (Bagrat + [[Classical Greek]]: - id, "the children").

Rival tales have been developed in Georgia and Armenia regarding the origins of the dynasties. The Bagratids of Armenia are speculated{{By whom|date=September 2014}} to have been an offshoot of the [[Orontid Dynasty]], [[Achaemenid]] [[satrap]]s and, later, kings of Armenia (c 400  – c 200 BC). They had their original appanage in [[Bagrevand]] in historic north-central Armenia and claimed their descent from a solar deity ''Angl-Thork'', the tutelary god of the Orontids, until their conversion to [[Christianity]]. Thereafter, this claim was abandoned in favor of the mythical ancestor of the Armenians, [[Hayk]]. Later, under [[Bible|biblical]] influences, they entertained another claim, of [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] ancestry, first articulated by [[Moses of Khorene]], and developed by the Georgians into a [[Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty|claim of their descent]] from the biblical king-prophet [[David]]<ref>Toumanoff, C. ''Iberia on the Eve of Bagratid Rule'', p.&nbsp;22, cited in: Suny (1994), p. 349</ref> Once the Georgian branch, who had quickly acculturated in the new environment,<ref>Rapp (2003), p.&nbsp;169</ref> assumed royal power, the myth of their biblical origin helped to assert their legitimacy and emerged as a main ideological pillar of the millennium-long Bagrationi rule in Georgia from 575 AD to 1810 AD.<ref>Rapp (2003), p. 234</ref> The claim is given no credence by modern scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}{{According to whom|date=September 2014}} The [[harp]] on their Coat of Arms is a reference that ancestry.

The traditional Georgian narrative regarding the origin of the Bagrationi can be traced back to the 11th century.  According to the Georgian chronicler of that time [[Sumbat Davitis-Dze]],<ref>Sumbat Davitis-Dze, ''The Life and Tale of the Bagratids'' (ცხოვრებაჲ და უწყებაჲ ბაგრატონიანთა ჩუენ ქართველთა მეფეთასა), see Suny (1994), p. 349; Rapp (2003), p. 337</ref> as published by Prince [[Vakhushti Bagrationi]] (1696–1757), who added chronological interpretations, the ancestors of the dynasty traced their descent to the [[Bible|biblical]] King [[David]], and came from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] around 530 [[Anno Domini|AD]]. Tradition has it that of seven refugee brothers of the [[Davidic line]], three of them settled in Armenia and the other four in [[Kartli]] (also known as [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] by [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] authors), where they intermarried with the local ruling houses and acquired some lands in hereditary possession. One of the four brothers, Guaram (died in 532), allegedly gave an origin to a line subsequently called Bagrationi after his son Bagrat.<ref>The earliest Georgian forms of the dynastic name are ''Bagratoniani'', ''Bagratuniani'' and ''Bagratovani'', changed subsequently into Bagrationi. These names as well as the Armenian ''Bagratuni'' and the modern designation ''Bagratid'' mean "the children of [[Bagrat]]" or "the house of/established by Bagrat".</ref> A successor, [[Guaram I of Iberia|Guaram]], was installed as a presiding prince of Kartli under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] protectorate and bestowed, on this occasion, with the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|Byzantine court title]] of ''Kouropalates''<ref>From the time of [[Justinian I]], the dignity of ''Kouropalates'' ({{lang-el|''κουροπαλάτης''}}, i.e., [[chancellor]]) was one of the highest in the [[Byzantine Empire]], reserved usually for members of the Imperial family. Its frequent conferment upon various Georgian and Armenian dynasts emphasizes their importance in the politics of those times. Suny (1994), p. 348</ref> in 575.<ref>[[Vakhushti Bagrationi]] (c. 1745), ''History of the Kingdom of Georgia''; a [[Russian language|Russian]] translation available at [http://www.armenianhouse.org/bagrationi/history-ru/6.html ArmenianHouse.org]. URL accessed on May 22. 2006.</ref> Thus, according to this version, began the dynasty of the Georgian Bagratids, who ruled until 1801.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] | edition= 11th| year= 1910–1911| title=[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Georgia|Georgia]]-}}</ref> This tradition had been given a general acceptance until the early 20th century.<ref>Suny (1994), 349</ref> While the [[Jews|Jewish]] origin, let alone the biblical descent of the Bagratids, has been largely discounted by modern scholarship, the issue of their origin still remains controversial. Several [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era historians of Georgia developed a view summarized by [[Nikoloz Berdzenishvili|N. Berdzenishvili]] ''et al.'' in their standard reference book on the history of Georgia:

{{cquote|The illustrious dynasty of the Bagratids originated in the most ancient Georgian kingdom of [[Tao-Klarjeti]]. This ancient Georgian kingdom is in Turkey and called [[Speri]] (today [[İspir]]).<ref>Centered on the modern-day district of İspir, northeastern [[Turkey]], this province is sometimes thought to have been the cradle of the [[Georgian people]] (Suny [1994], p. 11). It lay in what is frequently referred to as the Georgian marchlands where the two communities coexisted and intermingled for several centuries, but the Georgian Speri and the Armenian [[Sper (Armenia)|Sper]] may not always be absolutely identical (cf. [[Tao-Klarjeti|Tao]] and [[Tayk]], Rapp [2003], p. 14.).</ref> Through their farsighted, flexible policies, the Bagratid achieved great influence from the sixth through eighth centuries. One of their branches moved out to Armenia, the other to [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], and both won for themselves the dominant position among the other rulers of Transcaucasia.<ref>Berdzenishvili et al., ''Istoriia Gruzii'', p. 129, cited in: Suny (1994), p. 349</ref>}}

Certain, generation-by-generation, history of the family begins only in the 8th century, when the downfall of the rival clan of the [[Mamikonian]]s helped the Bagratids to emerge as a major force in the ongoing struggle against the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Arab rule]].

The [[Russia|Russian]]-[[United States|American]] scholar [[Cyril Toumanoff]] gives little credit to the medieval narratives, regarding both claimed biblical descent and descent from Guaram. Toumanoff traces the origins of the family to ancient Ispir, but according to him, the Georgian branch of the family appeared only in the 8th century, during an anti-Arab rebellion in 772, when one of the sons of [[Ashot III Bagratuni]], called Vasak fled into Iberia (Georgia).<ref name="Toumanoff1966">[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]], "Armenia and Georgia", in ''The Cambridge Medieval History'', Cambridge, 1966, vol. IV, p. 609. Accessible online at [http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/CMH1.htm]</ref> His son, Adarnase, was granted hereditary possessions in [[Klarjeti]] and [[Samtskhe-Javakheti|Samtskhe]] by the Georgian dynast [[Archil of Kakheti|Archil]]. Adarnase’s son Ashot gained the principate of Iberia and founded the last royal dynasty of Georgia.
