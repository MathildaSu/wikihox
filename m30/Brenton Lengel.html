==Collaboration with Rogue==
In August 2014, Lengel and [[Rogue (musician)|Rogue]] announced their collaboration on a rock opera called Afterall, based in part on the [[mythology]] and music of [[The Crüxshadows]], which received its first public reading at Dragon Con 2014. After serious revisions, the work was read again at the convention the following year.  Described as a fantasy adventure through the afterlife, Afterall begins with the death of the main character and her journey through a mythology filled mishmosh in an Oz-like purgatory.<ref name="Ref4"/>

==Political and religious views==
Lengel describes himself as an [[anarchist]], which he defines as "someone who believes the burden of proof rests on those who demand hierarchal privileges for themselves or others".<ref name="Ref37">''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thslfG9IaWA  Organizing towards Anarchy]'' The Stream. March 17th 2014. Al Jazeera. Retrieved April 3rd 2016.</ref> He also identifies as a [[libertarian communist]], having developed class consciousness as a result of his work as an underground artist; he has described the New York arts scene as "a world of nobles and peasants." considering himself as belonging to the latter group.<ref name="Ref1"/>

He attributes his [[anti-capitalism]] both to the distribution of wealth in the United States,<ref name="Ref1"/> and to the experience of caring for his fiancée, who suffers from [[Crohn’s Disease]], citing her initial sickness as a major reason for his participation in Occupy Wall Street.<ref name="Ref32"/>

Lengel theorizes that in a stateless society, the police and the military would ideally be replaced with a system of voluntary, non-hierarchal working groups dedicated to protecting people while remaining directly accountable to the communities in which they operate. He also stresses the need for these organizations to train their members in the arts and philosophy, citing the "Warrior Poet" archetype.<ref name="Ref1"/>

He supports voluntary hierarchy in the workplace but believes in the use of democracy. He is very attracted to the ideas of workers' self-management and the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] workplace models.<ref name="Ref1"/>

Lengel is a staunch environmentalist, citing both his time on the Appalachian Trail<ref name="Ref5"/><ref name="Ref7"/> and his faith as a [[Nichiren Buddhist]]. In the short term, he favors heavy environmental regulation and massive conservation efforts, and in the long run, a complete overthrow of global capitalism, seeing it as inherently hostile to the earth and humanity as a whole. Lengel also favors direct action against organizations that pose a clear and present danger, but believes that most “eco-terrorism” does more harm than good.<ref name="Ref1"/>

Lengel believes that revolution is "always inevitable." He does not consider himself a pacifist, but opposes the use of violence for reasons of faith, putting forth the "Human Revolution" of [[Josei Toda]] and [[Soka Gakkai International]]'s goal of Kosen Rufu as more humane and effective alternatives.<ref name="Ref1"/>
