'''Dr. Ben Isitt''' (born ca. 1978) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] historian and legal scholar with expertise in the relationship between social movements and the state. He holds public office as a city councillor and regional director in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada.

==Early life==
Isitt's interest in world affairs and politics was sparked by a high school history class in which he was one of only two students to argue from the [[left-wing politics|left]]. A [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] trip through the United States further influenced him; the grade 12 student saw "glaring poverty." He entered the [[University of Victoria]] in 1996 and later became news editor of ''[[The Martlet]]''. In a break after his first year, he took a 28-country trip through [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], including a time working on an [[Israel]]i [[kibbutz]]. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in history and professional writing in 2001.<ref>''Times Colonist'' (Victoria), 1 December 2002</ref>

==Graduate work and community involvement==
While a Master's degree student at [[University of Victoria|UVic]], Isitt entered the contest for Mayor of Victoria as an independent candidate in 2002. This followed the decision of the Victoria Civic Electors, municipal arm of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], against challenging the business-aligned incumbent [[Alan Lowe]]. Isitt's platform advocated for "a Cooperative & Green Victoria."  [[David Turner (politician)|David Turner]], a New Democrat and Victoria's mayor from 1990 to 1993, endorsed Isitt for mayor for "his energy, vision and commitment to a more just distribution of resources." With 40 volunteers and $9 000, Isitt won more than five thousand votes, 32% of all ballots cast.

In 2003, Isitt finished his [[Master of Arts]] in history with a thesis on the origins of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in British Columbia. The same year, he was elected to the executive of the [[New Democratic Youth of Canada]] as policy director, endorsing [[Joe Comartin]] for [[New Democratic Party leadership election, 2003|leader of the NDP]] and serving on the party's federal council.

For a time Isitt lived in [[New Brunswick]], pursuing a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Canadian history; he was active in the NDP there, helping to revive the youth wing and writing for ''[[The Brunswickan]]''. In 2005, Isitt once again ran for mayor, winning the nomination of the NDP-affiliated Victoria Civil Electors and capturing 43.6% of the votes cast, compared to Lowe's 51.9%.

In 2008, Isitt successfully defended his history dissertation ''Tug-of-War: The Working Class and Political Change in British Columbia, 1948-1972''.

==Scholarly achievements==

After working as a research officer for the B.C. [[Ministry of Advanced Education]], Isitt taught history at the [[University of Victoria]] and [[University of British Columbia]], including courses in Canadian and global history, labour, international relations and social movements.

Isitt is the author of three books, ''From Victoria to Vladivostok: Canada's Siberian Expedition, 1917-19'' (University of British Columbia Press, 2010), ''Militant Minority: British Columbia Workers and the Rise of a New Left, 1948-72'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011) and ''Duty with Dignity: The Professional Employees' Association in British Columbia'' (PEA, 2014). His research has been published in journals including the ''Canadian Historical Review'', ''[[Canadian Journal of Political Science]]'', ''[[Labour/Le Travail]]'', ''International Labor and Working Class History'', and ''BC Studies''.

Isitt has travelled to [[Russia]] several times, via [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], presenting research at universities throughout [[Siberia]] and the [[Russian Far East]].<ref>[http://dvfu.ru/-/doktor-filosofii-iz-kanady-obesaet-cerez-god-predstavit-v-dvfu-svou-knigu-o-grazdanskoj-vojne Far Eastern Federal University website, Vladivostok, 1 November 2012]</ref> During his first trip in 2008, he travelled across [[Russia]] along the [[Trans-Siberian Railroad]] completing research for ''From Victoria to Vladivostok'' (University of British Columbia Press, 2010). This forgotten chapter in the social and military history of Canada and Russia saw 4200 Canadians serve in the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied Intervention]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.ubcpress.com/company/press/PressReleaseFromVictoriaToVladivostok3Oct2010.pdf UBC Press, Media Release, 13 October 2010]</ref> A Russian-language edition of ''From Victoria to Vladivostok'' has been published by the Korpus company in [[Vladivostok]] and a French-language edition has been published by Laval University Press.

In 2010, Isitt completed a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of London]] External Programme. He currently holds a fellowship with the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Victoria]] for doctoral research on the legal history of property and social movements.
