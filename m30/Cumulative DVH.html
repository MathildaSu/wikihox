'''Cumulative DVH''' (or integral) is the volume graph from a given structure which receives at least a certain amount of [[radiation dose]]. It is calculated as the integral of the differential [[Dose-volume histogram]] (DVH) so it always begin at 100% (100% of the volume receives at least 0 dose) and ends at the maximum dose.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sambasivam|first1=Sasikumar|title=Dose Volumes Histogram|url=http://www.slideshare.net/sasikumars/dose-volume-histogram|website=slideshare|format=slides}}</ref> It is built calculating and plotting (on y-axis) the [[cumulative frequency]] corresponedent to the dose-bin on x-axis.
