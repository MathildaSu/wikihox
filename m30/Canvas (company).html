'''Canvas''' is a global technology company based in [[Reston, Virginia]]. Canvas provides [[mobile app]]s to expand data collection and make sharing easier for organizations of all sizes. They create apps to gather information, and the apps can be used from [[expense report]]s to installing soda fountains.<ref>{{cite news|last=King|first=Rachel|title=How Pepsi Bottling Ventures IT Says Yes, Even When Strapped for Resource|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/09/05/how-pepsi-bottling-ventures-it-says-yes-even-when-strapped-for-resources/|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=16 September 2013|date=5 September 2012}}</ref> All submissions are stored in the cloud and accessible for the user. Canvas allows the user to customize their apps and can include [[GPS]] location capture, photos, signature capture, and [[reference data]]. Data can be exported in a [[comma-separated values]] spreadsheet or a [[pdf]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Gahran|first=Amy|title=Tracking Inventory Have You Stressed?
