In [[physics]], '''Pop''' is the sixth [[derivative]] of the [[Position (vector)|position vector]] with respect to [[time]], with the first, second, and third, fourth, and fifth derivatives being [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], [[jerk (physics)|jerk]], [[jounce|snap]], and crackle, respectively; in other words, the pop is the rate of change of the crackle with respect to time.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://info.aiaa.org/Regions/Western/Orange_County/Newsletters/AIAAOC_SnapCracklePop_docx.pdf | title = Snap, Crackle, and Pop | last = Thompson | first = Peter M. | date = 5 May 2011 | website = AIAA Info | publisher = Systems Technology | location = Hawthorne, California | page = 1 | format = PDF | access-date = 17 May 2015 | quote = The common names for the first three derivatives are velocity, acceleration, and jerk.

:<math>\vec p =\frac {d \vec c} {dt}=\frac {d^2 \vec s} {dt^2}=\frac {d^3 \vec j} {dt^3}=\frac {d^4 \vec a} {dt^4}=\frac {d^5 \vec v} {dt^5}=\frac {d^6 \vec r} {dt^6}</math>

The following equations are used for constant pop:

:<math>\vec c = \vec c_0 + \vec p \,t </math>

:<math>\vec s = \vec s_0 + \vec c_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec p \,t^2 </math>

:<math>\vec j = \vec j_0 + \vec s_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec c_0 \,t^2 + \frac{1}{6} \vec p \,t^3 </math>

:<math>\vec a = \vec a_0 + \vec j_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec s_0 \,t^2 + \frac{1}{6} \vec c_0 \,t^3 + \frac{1}{24} \vec p \,t^4 </math>

:<math>\vec v = \vec v_0 + \vec a_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec j_0 \,t^2 + \frac{1}{6} \vec s_0 \,t^3 + \frac{1}{24} \vec c_0 \,t^4 + \frac{1}{120} \vec p \,t^5 </math>

:<math>\vec r = \vec r_0 + \vec v_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec a_0 \,t^2 + \frac{1}{6} \vec j_0 \,t^3 + \frac{1}{24} \vec s_0 \,t^4 + \frac{1}{120} \vec c_0 \,t^5 + \frac{1}{720} \vec p \,t^6 </math>

where

:<math>\vec p</math> : constant pop,
:<math>\vec c_0</math> : initial crackle,
:<math>\vec c</math> : final crackle,
:<math>\vec s_0</math> : initial jounce,

The name "Pop," along with "Snap" (also referred to as [[Jounce]]) and "[[Crackle (Physics) |Crackle]]" are somewhat facetious terms for the fourth, fifth, and sixth derivatives of position, being a reference to [[Snap, Crackle, and Pop]]. Currently, there are no well-accepted designations for the derivatives of pop. Higher-order derivatives of position are not commonly useful. Thus, there has been no consensus among physicists on the proper names for derivatives above pop. Despite this, physicists have proposed other names such as "Lock," "Drop," "Shot," and "Put" for seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth derivatives.

==Unit & Dimension==

The dimension of pop '''LT<sup>−6</sup>'''. In [[SI units]], this is "metres per hexic second", "metres per second per second per second per second per second per second", '''m/s<sup>6</sup>, m &middot; s<sup>−6</sup>''', or '''100 [[Gal (unit)|Gal]] per quartric second''' in [[CGS]] units. This pattern continues for higher order derivatives
