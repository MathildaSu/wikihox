'''Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson''' (born April 3, 1998) is an aspiring actress. She is the daughter of [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Debbie Rowe]].

==Early life==
Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson is the younger of the two children of [[Debbie Rowe]]. She has one older brother, [[Prince Michael Jackson I|Michael Joseph Jackson Jr.]], and one younger half-brother, [[Prince Michael Jackson II]]. She was born on April 3, 1998, in Beverly Hills, California. Jackson was allegedly named after the French city she was conceived in and both her father and paternal grandmother. Jackson was raised solely by her father, who received full custody rights following his divorce in 1999, although Rowe had stated it was her intention and agreed upon with Michael that he would raise and have custody of the children.<ref name="Jackson's mother granted custody">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8182387.stm|title=Jackson's mother granted custody|date=August 4, 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=November 9, 2009}}</ref> She grew up at [[Neverland Ranch]] with her siblings. Her father made longtime friends and actors [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Macaulay Culkin]] the godparents of her and her brother Prince. During her childhood, she and her siblings often wore masks during public outings with their father to hide their faces from the public.

In 2010, Jackson and her brothers gave an interview for [[Oprah Winfrey]] alongside their grandmother Katherine and their cousins about life after her father's death. She and her brother Prince also accepted the [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the [[2010 Grammy Awards]] on their father's behalf. She and her brother Prince became enrolled at the [[Buckley School (California)|Buckley School]], an exclusive private school in Sherman Oaks, California.<ref name="Michael Jackson's Kids Paris & Prince Enroll At The Buckley School">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/27/michael-jacksons-kids-par_n_696687.html|title=Michael Jackson's Kids Paris & Prince Enroll At The Buckley School|date=October 27, 2010|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref>There, she participated in [[flag football]], [[softball]] and [[cheerleading]] until Jackson left the school in 2013.

In 2011, Jackson signed on to star in the children's fantasy film, ''Lundon's Bridge and the Three Keys'', a story adapted from a book written by Dennis Christen. She and her siblings were mentioned in her aunt [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya's]] 2011 autobiography, ''[[Starting Over (autobiography)|Starting Over]]''. In May 2012, Jackson made ''[[People Magazine]]'''s ''Most Beautiful'' list.

Jackson, her two siblings and her grandmother Katherine made plans to put together a documentary film entitled ''Remembering Michael'' in remembrance of her deceased father. Costs associated with the making of the project was hoped to be funded via contributing fans through the [[crowdfunding]] site [[FundAnything]]. Due to the uproar from the fans and media sparked by this method, Katherine decided to shut down the campaign. In a sneak peek of the documentary, Paris remarked that her father had promised to teach her his famous dance move, the [[Moonwalk (dance)|Moonwalk]], but never had the chance. <ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/music-news/michael-jackson-mother-seeks-funds-doc-featuring-children-204827692.html Yahoo Music: Michael Jackson’s Mother Seeks Funds for New Doc Featuring His Children]</ref> Since the shut down of the online campaign, no further updates have been reported concerning this project.
