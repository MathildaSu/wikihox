The '''Heidelberg Center for Latin America''' for [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate studies]] and further training in [[Santiago de Chile]] was founded in 2001 and officially opened on 9 April 2002.[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6644356/Incorporacion-del-Profesor-Doctor-Peter.html]  It has the task of organising, managing and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by [[Heidelberg University]] or in co-operation with the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and the [[University of Chile]].  Heidelberg University has arranged co-operation agreements with both of these universities, the two most important universities in [[Chile]].  The centre also has responsibility for programmes of further training.  This initiative enables Heidelberg University to pursue its aims of passing on the accumulated knowledge of German research and teaching and to promote scientific co-operation between [[Germany]] and [[Latin America]].  The centre co-ordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America and provides a platform for scientific co-operation.

The centre is financially supported in these early years by [[Baden-Württemberg]] State Ministry for Science, Research and Art, Heidelberg University and the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD).  The Heidelberg Latin America Centre is run as a society subject to [[Chilean Civil Code|Chilean civil law]].  Its partners are Heidelberg University, with its corporate funds, and the [[Unterländer]] study fund, a public law foundation.
