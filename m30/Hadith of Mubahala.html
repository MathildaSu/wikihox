The '''Hadith of Mubahela''' is Muslim tradition about a debate ({{lang-ar|mubahela}}) of the [[Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] with the [[Christianity|Christians]] of [[Najran]] and summoned the members of his household, the [[Ahl al-Bayt]].

The event is recorded in several [[hadith]] collections and is referred to in the [[Qur'an]]ic [[Sura]] [[Al Imran]].

It is seen as one of the merits of Ahl al-Bayt and is widely used in [[Shia]]-[[Sunni]] arguments, and also used by the ShÄ«a to prove that [[Ali]] has the same authority over Muslims as Muhammad.

==Narration==

According to Islamic tradition, the [[Christians]] of [[Najran]] were unhappy about the rapid spread of Islam in the lands of [[Arabia]]. They wished to discuss this matter with Muhammad and arrived in [[Medina]] in 630 CE. Learned scholars were selected by the Christians who had a continuous dialogue with Muhammad for three days. It started on Saturday, when Sunday arrived, the Christians asked to leave the city to pray. Muhammad told them to stay and pray inside the [[mosque]], which they did.
 
Muhammad and the Christians were unable to arrive on any mutual understanding. At this point, Muhammad received revelation from God (recorded in Sura [[Al Imran]]):{{quote|But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of God on the liars. {{Quran-usc|3|61}}}}

The next morning, Muhammad emerged from his house with his closest family. He held the hand of [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] walking beside him, held [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husain]] in his arms, followed by his daughter [[Fatimah]] and finally by his son-in-law Ali. He came and stood with this family in front of the Christian [[bishop]]s who also came forward to perform the Mubahela.

The chief of the Christians was bishop [[Abul Harris]]. When he saw this small family of the Prophet he turned towards his fellow Christians and told them,{{quote|do not indulge in Mubahela with this family, for I am observing such pious faces that if they would order the mountain to come to them the mountain shall move towards them. It is therefore prudent to make treaty with them rather than confrontation of this spiritual imminence.}} They asked Muhammad for peace and it was accepted. Muhammad extended the hand of friendship towards them, a treaty was signed and both parties left on friendly terms.

==Hadith==

{{QuoteHadith|Shu'ba|matn=This hadith has been narrated. on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters. Amir b. Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas reported on the authority of his father that Muawiya b. Abi Sufyin appointed Sa'd as the Governor and said: What prevents you from abusing Abu Turab (Hadrat 'Ali), whereupon be said: It is because of three things which I remember Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said about him that I would not abuse him and even if I find one of those three things for me, it would be more dear to me than the red camelg. I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) say about 'Ali as he left behind hrin in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk). 'All said to him: Allah's Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Aren't you satisfied with being unto me what Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there is no prophethood after me. And I (also) heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly give this standard to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger and Allah and his Messenger love him too. He (the narrator) said: We have been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call 'Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory. (The third occasion is this) when the (following) verse was revealed:" Let us summon our children and your children." Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) called 'Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husain and said: O Allah, they are my family."|Sunni= as [[Sahih]]|SunniS=[[Sahih Muslim]]<ref>{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|031|5915}}</ref>}}
