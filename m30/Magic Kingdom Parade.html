The '''Magic Kingdom Parade''' is a large [[theatre|theatrical presentation]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in [[Walt Disney World]] which dates back to the beginning of the theme park. {{show by date|2016|10|10|As of March 2014, the daily parades are called Festival of Fantasy and [[Main Street Electrical Parade]]|As of October 10, 2016, the daily parade is called Festival of Fantasy|hour=-2}}.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://hanbanphotos.com/MagicKingdom/ | title =Magic Kingdom Attractions | last = | first = | date = | website =Han Ban Photos | publisher = | access-date =July 5, 2016 | quote = }}</ref>

==Parade Experience==
The early "character parades" were simple in execution, featuring Mickey Mouse leading the Walt Disney World Band, followed by a group of Disney characters, performers, and musicians walking or riding vehicles along the parade route. As the years went on, the parades became composed of many floats, each of which has its own theme music which is synchronized with a rhythm track that plays underneath the theme music for all floats simultaneously.  As the floats move through the park, the appropriate theme music plays through loudspeakers that are hidden on each float as well as through land-based loudspeakers along the route. Banks of audio speakers are individually controlled within specific zones on the parade route which enables parade intro music to play as the parade approaches each area.  A complex electronic tracking system manages the sound so that the correct theme music plays alongside each float as it travels by and pans from one group of loudspeakers to the next synchronously.  Originally designed by [[Don Dorsey]] for "America on Parade", the system was automated in 1980, and the new system was implemented for the Main Street Electrical Parade.  The system (DECS) is now standard across all Disney parks, and has been used by other parks as well.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorsey|first1=Don|url=http://www.dondorseyconsulting.com/dscoop.htm|accessdate=25 February 2015|title=Everyone loves a parade}}</ref>

Each of the parade floats are self-propelled units that are driven by highly trained Cast Members who are hidden inside the decorative floats.  All of the floats run only on battery power and recharged daily to prepare for each performance.<ref name="insidethemagic">{{cite web | url =http://www.insidethemagic.net/2010/05/behind-the-scenes-with-the-main-street-electrical-parade-at-walt-disney-world/ | title =Behind the scenes with the Main Street Electrical Parade at Walt Disney World | last =Ricky | first =Brigante | date =May 26, 2010 | website =Inside the Magic | publisher =

The '''[[Share A Dream Come True Parade]]''' which ran from 2001 until 2006 was changed to the '''Disney Dreams Come True Parade''' in 2006 and ended on January 22, 2009.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The Share A Dream Come True Parade had the Disney style floats with original music and characters but incorporated [[snow globe]]s which held many of the characters.  The Disney Dreams Come True Parade      was similar to the previous parade, though many of the floats were changed, and the snow globes were removed.  This parade also had new soundtrack which was previously been used for '''Disney's Dreams on Parade... Moving On''' at [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. The '''Celebrate A Dream Come True Parade''' replaced the Disney Dreams Come True Parade on January 23, 2009.
