'''16 Down''' (sometimes stylized as 16Down) is an alternative pop rock band from Zwolle, Sweden founded in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/16Down-159773157419095/about/|title=16 Down - About - Facebook}}</ref> The band released three albums between 2001 and 2007.

==History==
After Erwin Nyhoff, the only original member left in the Swedish band Prodigal Sons, decided to go solo under the name Prodigal Son in late 1996, the remaining members Jeroen Hobert, Marco Hovius and Arjan Pronk formed the band After Dust, later renaming themselves 16 Down.

In March 2001, the release of the single "Subtle Movements" earned the band media attention and chart success in The Netherlands<ref name="nporadio2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nporadio2.nl/artist/2512/16-down|title=16 Down (NPO Radio 2)}}</ref> and a spot at Lowlands 2001, a 3-day festival with over 57,000 tickets sold. Their debut album ''Headrush'' and its second single "Heaven Still Cries" followed, garnering more chart success for the band. The album's third single "If The Money's Right" featured guest vocals by Rudeboy of [[Urban Dance Squad]] and was used by [[Pepsi]] in a television commercial.<ref name="nporadio2" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F100lXH6e6s|title=16down pepsi commercial.dv - YouTube}}</ref>

In 2002, 16 Down participated in the Marlboro Flashback Tour series, performing a full set of [[Radiohead]] songs in a number of cities across the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?artist=3d4911f&query=tour:%28Flashback+to+Radiohead%29|title=Search for setlists: tour:(Flashback To Radiohead) - setlist.fm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/arjan/marlboro_flashback/|title=Marlboro Flashback - Rate Your Music}}</ref>

In the spring of 2003, 16 Down joined [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] on her her sold-out 17-date tour for her album ''Graduated Fool'',<ref name="emusicbit">{{cite web|url=http://www.emusicbit.com/artist/16%20Down|title=16 Down - emusic Bit}}</ref> followed by performances at the [[Parkpop]] and [[Bospop]] festivals that summer.

Before the release of the band's sophomore album, founding members Hobert ("for personal reasons")<ref name="nporadio2" /> and Pronk left the band, both later performing with The Horse Company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1196958-Arjan-Pronk|title=Arjan Pronk Discography at Discogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1087030-Jeroen-Hobert|title=Jeroen Hobert Discography at Discogs}}</ref>

''Life in a Fishbowl'' was preceded by the release of its lead single "The Day That I Met You" before being released in October 2003.<ref name="emusicbit" />

16 Down's third album ''F.L.O.'' was released at Paradiso in Amsterdam in 2007. A tour of 60 concerts followed in 2008 and 2009.

In 2011, frontman Marco Hovius built his own studio using money he made re-singing a [[Beck's Beer]] advertising song. There, he records and produces his own and other bands' music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/16Down-159773157419095/about|title=16 Down - About|quote=translated: ''In 2011 Hovius put a Vintage Studio Salland, where he makes music, composes, produces and records.''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://3voor12.vpro.nl/artikelen/overzicht/2005/juli/voicst-gem-en-peter-pan-breken-door-in-de-reclamewereld.html|title=Voicst, Gem and Peter Pan break...in the advertising world - 3voor12|quote=translated: ''Marco Hovius of 16Down built his studio with the money he received for re-singing the music for Beck's Beer in Germany.''}}</ref>
