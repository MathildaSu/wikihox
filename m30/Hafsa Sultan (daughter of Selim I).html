==Biography==

Hafsa Sultan was the sister of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (reign 1520–66) and the aunt of Sultan [[Selim II]] (reign 1566–74). At the age of about sixteen, in 1516, Hafsa was married to Iskenderzade Mustafa Pasha, who was not a vezir, son of Iskender Pasha, sometime Governor of [[Bosnia Eyalet]] and [[Rumelia Eyalet]]. 

Mustafa Pasha died in 1525-1526÷, and Hafsa became widow by his death. After Mustafa's death, she never married again. She died in 1538.
