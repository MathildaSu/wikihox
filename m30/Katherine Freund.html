'''Katherine Freund''' (born May 5, 1950) is an American [[activist]] who has spent decades of her life on alternative senior transportation solutions. She founded the [[ITNAmerica|Independent Transportation Network (ITN)]] in 1995, and has acted through her organization to offer dignified transportation alternatives to more than 11,000 seniors and visually impaired individuals to date.

Her work has been recognized through various national and international honors, including her election to a 2012 Ashoka Fellowship  and as an AARP Inspire Award Nominee in 2009.<ref>[http://usa.ashoka.org/fellow/katherine-freund]</ref><ref>[http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-11-2008/inspire_awards_2009_freund.html]</ref>

==Early life==

Freund was born on [[Mitchel Air Force Base|Mitchel Field Air Force Base]], [[Long Island]], [[New York]].

She attended Levittown Memorial High School, and completed her degree in English Literature at [[University at Buffalo]]  in 1972. After enjoying a career as a florist, gardening columnist and gardening TV show host, she later pursued a Master of Arts in Public Policy from the [[University of Southern Maine|Edmund S. Muskie School of Public Service]]  at [[University of Southern Maine]].

==The move into alternative senior transportation==

In 1988 Freund's three-year-old son, Ryan, was run over by an 84-year-old driver who claimed to have mistaken her son for a dog.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/12/get-older-drivers-off-the-road_n_6761062.html]</ref> He survived a traumatic brain injury that resulted from the accident.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2015/02/20/how-the-story-of-one-3-year-old-boy-started-a-senior-mobility-movement/]</ref>

Freund drew inspiration from the incident to seek solutions to the dangers inherent when seniors and visually impaired people drive. She pursued solutions through both policy and local action, and eventually conceptualized an organization that would provide rides in private automobiles that would recreate the comfort, independence and dignity that individuals experience when they drive their own vehicles. She founded the Independent Transportation Network (ITN) in 1995, and  developed the model over time as she refined the service through research and experience. ITN was initially funded by [[AARP]], the [[Federal Transit Administration]], the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], the [[Transportation Research Board]] and numerous private philanthropies as it grew into a sustainable organization with a replicable model.

In 2005, with a business planning grant from the [[Federal Transit Administration]] and the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], Freund founded [[ITNAmerica]].  In 2006, the Atlantic Philanthropies funded the national rollout of the ITN model and helped to create the ITN''America'' transportation network. She was also appointed by former President [[George W. Bush]] to the Advisory Committee for the 2005 [[White House Conference on Aging]].

In addition to serving as President of ITN''America'', Freund currently serves on the Transportation Research Board's Committee on the Safe Mobility of Seniors and co-chairs TRB’s Joint Subcommittee on Transportation Options for Seniors.

ITN''America'' continues to conduct research, work on policy issues, and provide education to promote safety and mobility for older people. As of May 2015, ITNAmerica operates through 27 affiliated communities in 22 states.

==Family and personal life==

Freund lives in [[Portland, Maine]]. She has one daughter and one son.
