He began singing and recording in 1984 but his two albums met with little success. Between 1985-1987 he studied classical music at the [[Vincent-D'Indy]] school of music in [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]], while continuing with studio work and beginning to write songs himself.

[[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] signed him in 1988, the same year that he signed a writing contract with [[ATV Music Publishing]] and signed with [[Daniel Lachance]] to be his manager.

Martin then recorded his third album in French, entitled ''Drôle de Nuit'', in New York. He scored his first radio hit with ''Elle ne c plus''. This song reached the top of the radio chart. Two of the album's songs reach Number 1 in the charts of French-speaking Canadian radio stations.

He changed manager again in 1990, signing with Ben Kaye. He went on to record his fourth album, ''Quand on se donne'', this time on the [[Sony Music]] label. Four songs from this were hits in French-speaking Canada and the album was [[certified gold]].
