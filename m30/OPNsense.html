'''OPNsense''' is an [[open-source software]] [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] distribution based on [[FreeBSD]]. It is typically used for [[Stateful firewall|stateful]] perimeter firewalls, security [[computer appliance|appliances]], [[intrusion detection system]]s, [[router (computing)|routers]], [[Cloud computing|cloud routers]], [[wireless access point]]s, [[DHCP]] and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] servers, [[VPN]] endpoints, and [[unified threat management]]-machines. The OPNsense project is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[pfSense]].

The OPNsense distribution can be downloaded for free<ref name=SF-OPNsense>{{cite web|title=OPNsense is an open source, easy to use firewall and routing platform|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/opnsense/|website=http://sourceforge.net|publisher=sourfeforge|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> and installed on computer [[hard disk]]s, [[Solid-state drive|SSD]]s, [[flash memory|Compact Flash]] cards as well as on [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Live CD]]s. It runs on a number of [[embedded system]]s and generic low power<ref name=NetboardA10>{{cite web|title=Netboard A10|url=https://www.deciso.com/netboard-a10/#.VPMsvi5odQI|website=deciso.com|publisher=Deciso B.V.|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=AMD-NewFirewalls>{{cite web|last1=Schellevis|first1=Jos|title=Under the Hood: AMD G-Series SOC Delivers the Horsepower for Next Generation Firewalls|url=http://community.amd.com/community/amd-blogs/amd-business/blog/2015/02/11/under-the-hood-amd-g-series-soc-delivers-the-horsepower-for-next-generation-firewalls|website=community.amd.com|publisher=Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref> [[personal computer]]s.

OPNsense can be configured and upgraded through a web-based interface. It is focused on code quality and easy development, implementing the [[Model–view–controller|MVC]] paradigm.<ref name=OPNsense-WhyFork/>

==Name==
The name was derived from the [[suffix]] of its progenitor's name [[pfSense]]<ref>{{cite web|url=//blog.pfsense.org/?p=114|title=So what does pfSense stand for/mean, anyway?|first=Chris|last=Buechler|date=June 21, 2007|work=pfSense Digest}}</ref> and ''open'', and stands for: ''"Open (source) makes sense."''<ref name="OPNsense-About">{{cite web|url=http://opnsense.org/about/about-opnsense/|title=About OPNsense|date=January 2, 2015|work=OPNsense website}}</ref> The name was derived from the fact that it aims to keep the source base of a distribution like OPNsense open and free to developers, [[entrepreneur]]s and non-technical users as well.

==History==
The project started on 2 January 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opnsense.org/opnsense-version-15-1-released//?p=97|title=OPNsense 15.1-RELEASED|first=|last=|date=January 2, 2015|work=OPNsense website}}</ref> as a fork of [[pfSense]], which started as a [[Fork (software development)|project fork]] from [[m0n0wall]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.pfsense.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=68&Itemid=76|title=pfSense Open Source Firewall Distribution - History}}</ref> The project gives three reasons for forking:<ref name="OPNsense-About"/><ref name=OPNsense-WhyFork>{{cite web|title=OPNsense:So why did we fork?|url=https://wiki.opnsense.org/index.php/OPNsense:So_why_did_we_fork%3F|website=opnsense.org|publisher=OPNsense|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>

* '''Technical''' – focus on clean codebase that can be used by developers and is maintainable.
* '''Community''' – build a thriving community that gives and shares.
* '''License''' – a simple 2-clause BSD license for the sources and the tools to [[Build automation|build]] it.

Since May 8, 2015, the [[HardenedBSD]] project teamed up with OPNsense to offer HardenedBSD-backed versions of OPNSense.<ref name=HardBSD-Announce>{{cite news|last1=Webb|first1=Shawn|title=HardenedBSD Teams Up With OPNSense|url=https://hardenedbsd.org/article/shawn-webb/2015-05-08/hardenedbsd-teams-opnsense|accessdate=13 May 2015|publisher=The HardenedBSD Project|date=8 May 2015}}</ref> The free HardenedBSD project offers security enhancements such as [[Address space layout randomization|ASLR]], [[PaX#PAGEEXEC|PAGEEXEC]], [[NX bit|NOEXEC]], [[Position-independent code|Position Independent Executable]] (PIE), and hardening of [[memory protection]] and [[ptrace]]. According to OPNsense developers, OPNsense will benefit from these security enhancements and other hardened FreeBSD code. The first OPNsense images on top of HardenedBSD were released on June 10, 2015.<ref name=HardenedOPNsense10June2015>{{cite news|last1=Webb|first1=Shawn|title=First Experimental OPNSense Images With HardenedBSD|url=https://hardenedbsd.org/article/shawn-webb/2015-06-10/first-official-opnsense-images-hardenedbsd|accessdate=11 June 2015|publisher=The HardenedBSD Project.|date=June 10, 2015}}</ref>

Each OPNsense release has a [[Software versioning|version number]] that consists of the year and month number of the release. The version number for the future release is provisional; in time of the scheduled release, the future version number (blue) becomes the version number of the latest stable release (green) accordingly. 

OPNsense releases are also given [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[code name]]s, using an adjective and the name of an animal. The code names are in alphabetical order, allowing a quick determination of which release is newer.

The releases are timed to be approximately bi-annual, resulting in a summer and a winter release per year.

Upgrades between releases have to be done from one release to the next release in a gradual manner, simply by updating a production installation over the calendary release mark.

Basic software support is based on FreeBSD-10.1, until 31 December 2016<ref name=10.1-EoL>{{cite web|title=FreeBSD Security Information - End of Life|url=https://www.freebsd.org/security/|publisher=The FreeBSD Project.|accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>
